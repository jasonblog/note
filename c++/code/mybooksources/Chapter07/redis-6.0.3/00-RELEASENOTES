Redis 6.0 release notes
=======================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:

LOW:      No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH:     There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
SECURITY: There are security fixes in the release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
Redis 6.0.3     Released Sat May 16 18:10:21 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: a crash introduced in 6.0.2 is now fixed.

1eab62f7e Remove the client from CLOSE_ASAP list before caching the master.

================================================================================
Redis 6.0.2     Released Fri May 15 22:24:36 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: many not critical bugfixes in different areas.
                          Critical fix to client side caching when
                          keys are evicted from the tracking table but
                          no notifications are sent.

The following are the most serious fix:

* XPENDING should not update consumer's seen-time
* optimize memory usage of deferred replies - fixed
* Fix CRC64 initialization outside the Redis server itself.
* stringmatchlen() should not expect null terminated strings.
* Cluster nodes availability checks improved when there is
  high Pub/Sub load on the cluster bus.
* Redis Benchmark: Fix coredump because of double free
* Tracking: send eviction messages when evicting entries.
* rax.c updated from upstream antirez/rax.
* fix redis 6.0 not freeing closed connections during loading.

New features:

* Support setcpuaffinity on linux/bsd
* Client Side Caching: Add Tracking Prefix Number Stats in Server Info
* Add --user argument to redis-benchmark.c (ACL)

================================================================================
Redis 6.0.1     Released Sat May 02 00:06:07 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes a crash when builiding against
                      Libc malloc.

Here we revert 8110ba888, an optimization that causes a crash due to a
bug in the code. It does not happen with the default allocator because of
differences between Jemalloc and libc malloc, so this escaped all our
testing but was reported by a user. We'll add back the original optimization
that was reverted here later, after checking what happens: it is not a
critical optimization.

The other commits are minor stuff:

================================================================================
Redis 6.0.0 GA  Released Thu Apr 30 14:55:02 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: many bugs fixed compared to the last release
                          candidate. Better to upgrade if you see things
                          affecting your environment in the changelog.

Hi all, finally we have Redis 6.0.0 GA! Enjoy this new Redis release.
Most of the documentation was updated today so that you can likely
find what you are looking for about the new features at redis.io.
This is the list of what changed compared to the previoius release candidate:

* XCLAIM AOF/replicas propagation fixed.
* Client side caching: new NOLOOP option to avoid getting notified about
  changes performed by ourselves.
* ACL GENPASS now uses HMAC-SHA256 and have an optional "bits" argument.
  It means you can use it as a general purpose "secure random strings"
  primitive!
* Cluster "SLOTS" subcommand memory optimization.
* The LCS command is now a subcommand of STRALGO.
* Meaningful offset for replicas as well. More successful partial
  resynchronizations.
* Optimize memory usage of deferred replies.
* Faster CRC64 algorithm for faster RDB loading.
* XINFO STREAM FULL, a new subcommand to get the whole stream state.
* CLIENT KILL USER <username>.
* MIGRATE AUTH2 option, for ACL style authentication support.
* Other random bugfixes.

Enjoy Redis 6! :-)

Redis 6.0-rc4     Released Thu Apr 16 16:10:35 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: If you are using RC3 without issues, don't rush.

Hi all, this the latest release candidate of Redis 6. This is likely to
be very similar to what you'll see in Redis 6 GA. Please test it and
report any issue :-)

Main changes in this release:

    * Big INFO speedup when using a lot of of clients.
    * Big speedup on all the blocking commands: now blocking
      on the same key is O(1) instead of being O(N).
    * Stale replicas now allow MULTI/EXEC.
    * New command: LCS (Longest Common Subsequence).
    * Add a new configuration to make DEL like UNLINK.
    * RDB loading speedup.
    * Many bugs fixed (see the commit messages at the end of this node)

See you in 14 days for Redis 6 GA.

================================================================================
Redis 6.0-rc3     Released Tue Mar 31 17:42:39 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: A connection management bug introduced with the
                          SSL implementation can crash Redis easily.

Dear users, this is a list of the major changes in this release, please check 
the list of commits for detail:

* Fix crash due to refactoring for SSL, for the connection code.
* Precise timeouts for blocking commands. Now the timeouts have HZ
  resolution regardless of the number of connected clinets. New timeouts
  are stored in a radix tree and sorted by expire time.
* Fix rare crash when resizing the event loop because of CONFIG maxclients.
* Fix systemd readiness after successful partial resync.
* Redis-cli ask password mode to be prompted at startup (for additional safety).
* Keyspace notifications added to MIGRATE / RESTORE.
* Threaded I/O bugs fixed.
* Implement new ACL style AUTH in Sentinel.
* Make 'requirepass' more backward compatible with Redis <= 5.
* ACL: Handle default user as disabled if it's off regardless of "nopass".
* Fix a potential inconsistency when upgrading an instance in Redis Cluster
  and restarting it. The instance will act as a replica but will actually be
  set as a master immediately. However the choice of what to do with already
  expired keys, on loading, was made from the POV of replicas.
* Abort transactions after -READONLY error.
* Many different fixes to module APIs.
* BITFIELD_RO added to call the command on read only replicas.
* PSYNC2: meaningful offset implementation. Allow the disconnected master
  that is still sending PINGs to replicas, to be able to successfully
  PSYNC incrementally to new slaves, discarding the last part of the
  replication backlog consisting only of PINGs.
* Fix pipelined MULTI/EXEC during Lua scripts are in BUSY state.
* Re-fix propagation API in modules, broken again after other changes.

================================================================================
Redis 6.0 RC2     Released Thu Mar 05 15:40:53 CET 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Normal bugfixing release of a non-GA branch.

Hi Redis users, Redis 6 is approaching and will be released 30th of April.
New release candidates will be released at the end of March, then another
one mid April, to finally reach the GA at the end of April.

Redis 6 RC2 brings many fixes and new things, especially in the area of
client side caching. This is the list of big changes in this release. As
usually you can find the full list of commits at the end:

New features and improvements:

* ACL LOG: log denied commands, keys accesses and authentications.
* Client side caching redesigned. Now we use keys not caching slots.
* Client side caching: Broadcasting mode implemented.
* Client side caching: OPTIN/OPTOUT modes implemented.
* Remove RDB files used for replication in persistence-less instances (option).

Fixes (only selected ones, see commits for all the fixes):

* Different fixes to streams in edge cases.
* Fix duplicated CLIENT SETNAME reply because of RESP3 changes.
* Fix crash due to new active expire division by zero.
* Avoid sentinel changes promoted_slave to be its own replica.
* Fix bug on KEYS command where pattern starts with * followed by \x00.
* Threaded I/O: now the main thread is used as well to do I/O.
* Many fixes to modules APIs, and more to come in the next RCs.
* ld2string should fail if string contains \0 in the middle.
* Make the Redis test more reliable.
* Fix SPOP returning nil (see #4709). WARNING: API change.

================================================================================
Redis 6.0 RC1   Released Thu Dec 19 09:58:24 CEST 2019
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first RC of Redis 6.

Introduction to the Redis 6 release
===================================

Redis 6 improves Redis in a number of key areas and is one of the largest
Redis releases in the history of the project, so here we'll list only
the biggest features in this release:

* The modules system now has a number of new APIs that allow module authors
  to make things otherwise not possible in the past. It is possible to
  store arbitrary module private data in RDB files, to hook on different
  server events, capture and rewrite commands executions, block clients on
  keys, and so forth. 
* The Redis active expire cycle was rewritten for much faster eviction of keys
  that are already expired. Now the effort is tunable.
* Redis now supports SSL on all channels.
* ACL support, you can define users that can run only certain commands and/or
  can only access only certain keys patterns.
* Redis now supports a new protocol called RESP3, which returns more
  semantical replies: new clients using this protocol can understand just
  from the reply what type to return to the calling program.
* There is server-side support for client-side caching of key values. This
  feature is still experimental and will get more changes during the next
  release candidates, but you can already test it and read about it here:
  https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching
* Redis can now optionally use threads to handle I/O, allowing to serve
  2 times as much operations per second in a single instance when
  pipelining cannot be used.
* Diskless replication is now supported even on replicas: a replica is now
  able, under certain conditions the user can configure, to load the RDB
  in the first synchronization directly from the socket to the memory.
* Redis-benchmark now supports a Redis Cluster mode.
* SRANDMEMBER and similar commands have a better distribution.
* Redis-cli improvements.
* Systemd support rewritten.
* A Redis Cluster proxy was released here:
  https://github.com/artix75/redis-cluster-proxy
* A Disque module for Redis was released here:
  https://github.com/antirez/disque-module

Thanks to all the users and developers who made this release possible.
We'll follow up with more RC releases, until the code looks production ready
and we don't get reports of serious issues for a while.

A special thank you for the amount of work put into this release

Migrating from 5.0 to 6.0
=========================

Redis 6.0 is mostly a strict superset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 5.0 to 6.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 6.0 release:

* The SPOP <count> command no longer returns null when the set key does not
  exist. Now it returns the empty set as it should and as happens when it is
  called with a 0 argument. This is technically a fix, however it changes the
  old behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credits: For each release, a list of changes with the relative author is
provided. Where not specified the implementation and design is done by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. Thanks to Redis Labs for making all this possible.
Also many thanks to all the other contributors and the amazing community
we have.

Commit messages may contain additional credits.

Enjoy,
Salvatore
