<h1>6.828 Fall 2007 Lab 2: Memory Management</h1>

<p>
<b>Handed out Wednesday, September 12, 2007<br>
Due Thursday, September 27, 2007</b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab, your will write the memory management code for your
operating system. Memory management is comprised of two components.
</p>

<p>
The first component is managing the physical memory of the computer
so that the kernel can allocate and free
physical memory as needed.
The x86 divides physical memory into 4096-byte regions called
<i>pages</i>.
Your task will be to maintain data structures that record
which physical pages are free and which are
allocated, and how many processes are sharing
each allocated page.  You will also write the routines to allocate and
free pages of memory.
</p>

<p>
The second component of memory management
is <i>virtual memory</i>,
where we set up the PC'S Memory Management Unit (MMU) hardware
to map the virtual addresses used by software
to physical addresses.
You will modify JOS to set up virtual memory mappings
according to a specification we provide.
</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>
Download the code for lab 2 from
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab2/lab2-handout.tar.gz  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab2/lab2-handout.tar.gz%27" tppabs="http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab2/lab2-handout.tar.gz">
http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab2/lab2-handout.tar.gz</a>
and untar it into your 6.828 directory,
just as you did for lab 1.
You will then need to merge the changes
between our lab 1 and lab 2 source code trees
into your own kernel code resulting from completing lab 1.

<p>
In this and future labs you will progressively build on this same kernel.
With each new lab we will hand out a source tree
containing additional files and possibly some changes to existing files.
Compare the new source tree
against the one we provided for the previous lab
in order to figure out what new code you need to incorporate into your kernel.
You may find it useful to keep a "pristine" copy
of our source tree for each lab around
along with your modified versions.
You should expect to become intimately familiar
with the Unix <tt>diff</tt> utility if you aren't already,
and <tt>patch</tt> can be highly useful as well.
"Diff-and-merge" is an important and unavoidable component
of all real OS development activity,
so any time you spend learning to do this effectively
is time well spent.

<p>
One option is to just merge in your changes manually.  If you remember
what functions you modified, you can copy the changes into the lab2
code.  To actually see what changes you made, and try to patch them in
to the code, run the following sequence of commands.  Be warned that
these utilities are not perfect, and merging in the changes by hand
may be simpler.

<pre>
cd ~/6.828

# this creates a tar of what you handed in, for backup purposes
tar czvf lab1-handin.tar.gz lab1

mkdir given-code
cd given-code
tar xzf ../lab1.tar.gz
cd ..
mv given-code/lab1 lab1-unchanged

# now we have the handed out lab1 code in lab1-unchanged

diff -r -u lab1-unchanged lab1 > lab1-changes.txt

# It is very important to look at the patch file.  All of the changes
# in it should be for code that you added to lab 1 and want to bring
# to lab 2.  If there are other changes (like changes to the
# makefiles), then you should NOT run the 'patch' command below.
# Instead, you should apply the patch by hand.  If you decide to apply
# it with patch, then run the commands below.

cd lab2
patch -p1 -u < ../lab1-changes.txt

# if any chunks failed, look at the rejects
# files (.rej) and merge those changes in yourself.
</pre>

<p>Anyone serious about software development should consider using a
source code management system like

instructions</a> on setting up a CVS repository.  The course staff is
a big fan of CVS, by the way.</p>

<p>
Lab 2 contains the following new source files,
which you should browse through:
<ul>
<li>	<tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt>
<li>	<tt>kern/pmap.c</tt>
<li>	<tt>kern/pmap.h</tt>
<li>	<tt>kern/kclock.h</tt>
<li>	<tt>kern/kclock.c</tt>
<li>	<tt>kern/kdebug.h</tt>
<li>	<tt>kern/kdebug.c</tt>

</ul>

<tt>memlayout.h</tt> describes the layout of the virtual
address space that you must implement by modifying <tt>pmap.c</tt>.
<tt>memlayout.h</tt> and <tt>pmap.h</tt> define the Page
structure that you'll use to keep track of which pages of
physical memory are free.
<tt>kclock.c</tt> and <tt>kclock.h</tt>
manipulate
the PC's battery-backed clock and CMOS RAM hardware,
in which the BIOS records the amount of physical memory the PC contains,
among other things.
The code in <tt>pmap.c</tt> needs to read this device hardware
in order to figure out how much physical memory there is,
but that part of the code is done for you:
you do not need to know the details of how the CMOS hardware works.
The last two files provide support for extending the kernel monitor.

<p>
Pay particular attention to <tt>memlayout.h</tt> and <tt>pmap.h</tt>,
since this lab requires you to use and understand many of the
definitions they contain.


<h3>Lab Requirements</h3>

In this lab and subsequent labs,
do all of the regular exercises described in the lab
and <i>at least one</i> challenge problem.
(Some challenge problems are more challenging than others, of course!)
Additionally, write up brief answers
to the questions posed in the lab
and a short (e.g., one or two paragraph) description of what you did
to solve your chosen challenge problem.
If you implement more than one challenge problem,
you only need to describe one of them in the write-up,
though of course you are welcome to do more.
Place the write-up in a file called <tt>answers.txt</tt> (plain text)
or <tt>answers.html</tt> (HTML format)
in the top level of your <tt>lab2</tt> directory
before handing in your work.

<h3>Hand-In Procedure</h3>

<p>
When you are ready to hand in your lab code and write-up,
run <tt>gmake handin</tt> in the <tt>lab2</tt> directory.
This will first do a <tt>gmake clean</tt>
to clean out any <tt>.o</tt> files and executables,
and then create a tar file called <tt>lab2-handin.tar.gz</tt>
with the entire contents of your lab2 directory.
You should submit the tar file
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/cgi-bin/828handin  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/cgi-bin/828handin%27" tppabs="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/cgi-bin/828handin">here</a>.

<p>
As before, we will be grading your solutions with a grading program.
You can run <tt>gmake grade</tt> in the <tt>lab2</tt> directory
to test your kernel with the grading program.
You may change any of the kernel source and header files you need to
in order to complete the lab,
but needless to say you must not change
or otherwise subvert the grading code.

<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
	Modify your stack backtrace
	function to display, for each EIP, the function name,
        source file name, and line number corresponding to that EIP.
        To help you we have provided
	<tt>debuginfo_eip</tt>, which looks up <tt>eip</tt> in
	the symbol table and is defined	in <tt>kern/kdebug.c</tt>.
        <p>In <tt>debuginfo_eip</tt>, where do <tt>__STAB_*</tt> come
        from? This question has a long answer; to help you to
        discover the answer, here are some things you might want to
        do:
        <ul>
	  <li> look in the file <tt>kern/kernel.ld</tt> for <tt>__STAB_*</tt>
	  <li> run <tt>i386-jos-elf-objdump -h obj/kern/kernel</tt>
	  <li> run <tt>i386-jos-elf-objdump -G obj/kern/kernel</tt>
	  <li> run <tt>i386-jos-elf-gcc -pipe -nostdinc -O2
	  -fno-builtin -I. -MD -Wall -Wno-format -DJOS_KERNEL -gstabs
	  -c -S kern/init.c</tt>, and look at init.s.
	  <li> see if the bootloader loads the symbol table in memory as part of
	  loading the kernel binary
	</ul>
	<p>Complete the implementation of <tt>debuginfo_eip</tt> by
	inserting the call to <tt>stab_binsearch</tt> to find the line
	number for an address.
        <p>Extend your implementation of <tt>mon_backtrace</tt> to
        call <tt>debuginfo_eip</tt> and print a line for each
        stack frame of the form:
	<pre>
Stack backtrace:
kern/monitor.c:74: mon_backtrace+10
  ebp f0119ef8  eip f01008ce  args 00000001 f0119f20 00000000 00000000 2000000a
kern/monitor.c:143: monitor+10a
  ebp f0119f78  eip f01000e5  args 00000000 f0119fac 00000275 f01033cc fffffffc
kern/init.c:78: _panic+51
  ebp f0119f98  eip f010133e  args f01033ab 00000275 f01033cc f0103473 f01030bc
kern/pmap.c:711: page_check+9e
  ebp f0119fd8  eip f0100082  args f0102d20 00001aac 000006a0 00000000 00000000
kern/init.c:36: i386_init+42
  ebp f0119ff8  eip f010003d  args 00000000 00000000 0000ffff 10cf9a00 0000ffff
	</pre>
        The <tt>read_eip()</tt> function may help with the first line.
        You may find that the some functions are missing from the
        backtrace. For example, you will probably see a call to
        <tt>monitor()</tt> but not to <tt>runcmd()</tt>. This is
        because the compiler in-lines some function calls.
        Other optimizations may cause you to see unexpected line
        numbers. If you get rid of the <tt>-O2</tt> from
        <tt>GNUMakefile</tt>, the backtraces may make more sense
        (but your kernel will run more slowly).
</p></div>

<h2>Part 1: Physical Page Management</h2>

The operating system must keep track of
which parts of physical RAM are free
and which are currently in use.
JOS manages the PC's physical memory
with <i>page granularity</i>
so that it can use the MMU to map and protect each
piece of allocated memory.

<p>
You'll now write the physical page allocator.  It keeps track of which
pages are free with a linked list of <tt>struct Page</tt> objects,
each corresponding to a physical page.  You need to write the physical
page allocator before you can write the rest of the virtual memory
implementation, because your page table managment code will need to
allocate physical memory in which to store page tables.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
	In the file <code>kern/pmap.c</code>,
	you must implement code for the following functions.

	<pre>
        boot_alloc()
	page_init()
	page_alloc()
	page_free()
	</pre>
        You also need to add some code to <code>i386_vm_init()</code>
        in <tt>pmap.c</tt>, as indicated by comments there. For now,
        just add the code needed before the call to <code>check_page_alloc()</code>.
	<p>
	<code>check_page_alloc()</code> tests your physical page allocator.
        You should boot JOS and see whether <code>check_page_alloc()</code>
        reports success. Fix your code so that it passes. You may find it
        helpful to add your own <code>assert()</code>s to verify that
        your own assumptions are correct.
</p></div>

<p></p>

<h2>Part 2: Virtual Memory</h2>

<!--
<p><i> Aside: Contrast this to the VM layout for version 7 Unix on the
PDP/11-40.  You will recall from lecture, that in v7, the kernel and
each user process each have their own address spaces.
</i>
-->

<p>
Before doing anything else,
familiarize yourself with the x86's
protected-mode memory management architecture:
namely <i>segmentation</i> and <i>page translation</i>.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>

	Intel 80386 Reference Manual</a>,
	if you haven't done so already.
	Although JOS relies most heavily on page translation,
	you will also need a basic understanding
	of how segmentation works in protected mode
	to understand what's going on in JOS.
</p></div>

<h3>Virtual, Linear, and Physical Addresses</h3>

<p>
In x86 terminology,
a <i>virtual address</i>
consists of a segment selector and an offset within the segment.
A <i>linear address</i>
is what you get after segment translation but before page translation.
A <i>physical address</i>
is what you finally get after both segment and page translation.
Be sure you understand the difference
between these three types or "levels" of addresses!

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
	Review the
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html%27" tppabs="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html">

		Bochs user manual</a>,
	and make sure you understand which debugger commands
	deal with which kinds of addresses.
	In particular, note the various <code>vb</code>, <code>lb</code>,
	and <code>pb</code> breakpoint commands to set breakpoints at
	virtual, linear, and physical addresses.
	The default <code>b</code> command breaks at a <i>physical</i> address.
	Also note that the <code>x</code> command
	examines data at a <i>linear</i> address,
	while the command <code>xp</code> takes a physical address.  
	Sadly there is no <code>xv</code> at all.
</p></div>

<p>The JOS kernel source uses different type names for virtual and
physical addresses:
the type <code>uintptr_t</code> represents virtual
addresses, and <code>physaddr_t</code> represents physical addresses.
Both these types are really just synonyms for 32-bit integers
(<code>uint32_t</code>), so the compiler won't stop you from assigning one
type to another!  Every pointer value in JOS should be a virtual address
(once paging is set up), since only virtual addresses can be dereferenced:
kernel memory references go through the paging hardware.
To summarize:</p>

<table align='center'>
<tr><th>C type</th><th>Address type</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>T*</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Virtual</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>uintptr_t</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Virtual</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>physaddr_t</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Physical</td></tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<div class="todo required">
<span class="header">Question</span>
  <ol><li>Assuming that the
following JOS kernel code 
compiles correctly and doesn't crash, what type
should variable <code>x</code> have, <code>uintptr_t</code> or
<code>physaddr_t</code>?

<pre>
	<i>mystery_t</i> x;
	char* value = return_a_pointer();
	*value = 10;
	x = (<i>mystery_t</i>) value;</pre></li>
</ol></div>


<p>
In Part 3 of Lab 1 we noted that
the boot loader sets up the x86 segmentation hardware
so that the kernel appears to run at its link address of 0xf0100000,
even though it is actually loaded in physical memory
just above the ROM BIOS at 0x00100000.
In other words,
the kernel's <i>virtual</i> starting address at this point is 0xf0100000,
but its <i>linear</i> and <i>physical</i> starting addresses
are both 0x00100000.
The kernel's linear and physical addresses are the same
because we have not yet initialized or enabled page translation.

<p>
In the virtual memory layout you are going to set up for JOS,
we will stop using the x86 segmentation hardware for anything interesting,
and instead start using page translation
to accomplish everything we've already done with segmentation
and much more.
That is, after you finish this lab
and the JOS kernel successfully enables paging,
linear addresses will be the same as
(the offset portion of)
the kernel's <i>virtual</i> addresses,
rather than being the same as physical addresses
as they are when the boot loader first enters the kernel.

<h3>Page Table Management</h3>

Now you'll write a set of routines to manage page tables: to insert
and remove linear-to-physical mappings, and to create page table pages
when needed.

<p>
In future labs you will often map the same
physical page at multiple virtual addresses (or in the address spaces
of multiple environments), so you will keep a count of the number of
times each physical page is mapped in the corresponding
<tt>Page</tt>'s <tt>pp_ref</tt>.  The count should be equal to the
number of pointers to the page in the page
table(s) <em>below <tt>UTOP</tt></em> (The mappings
above <tt>UTOP</tt> are mostly just set up at boot time by the kernel
and are not tracked by the reference-counting system).

When the count goes to zero, the physical page can be freed.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
	In the file <code>kern/pmap.c</code>,
	you must implement code for the following functions.

	<pre>
        pgdir_walk()
        boot_map_segment()
        page_lookup()
        page_remove()
        page_insert()
	</pre>
	<code>page_check()</code>, called from <code>i386_vm_init()</code>,
        tests your page table management routines.
        You should make sure it reports success before proceeding.
</p></div>

<h2>Part 3: Kernel Address Space</h2>

<p>
JOS divides the processor's 32-bit linear address space
into two parts.
User environments (processes),
which we will begin loading and running in lab 3,
will have control over the layout and contents of the lower part,
while the kernel always maintains complete control over the upper part.
The dividing line is defined somewhat arbitrarily
by the symbol <code>ULIM</code> in <code>inc/memlayout.h</code>,
reserving approximately 256MB of linear (and therefore virtual) address space
for the kernel.
This explains why we needed to give the kernel
such a high link address in lab 1:
otherwise there would not be enough room in the kernel's virtual address space
to map in a user environment below it at the same time.


<h3>Permissions and Fault Isolation</h3>

<p>
Since kernel and user memory
are both present in each environment's address space,
we will have to use permission bits in our x86 page tables
allow user code access only to the user part of the address space.
Otherwise bugs in user code might overwrite kernel data,
causing a crash or more subtle malfunction;
user code might also be able to steal other environments' private data.
We do this as follows.

<p>The user environment will have no permission to any of the
memory above <code>ULIM</code>, while the kernel will be able to
read and write this memory.  For the address range
<code>(UTOP,ULIM]</code>, both the kernel and the user environment have
the same permission: they can read but not write this address range.
This range of address is used to expose certain kernel data structures
read-only to the user environment.  Lastly, the address space below
<code>UTOP</code> is for the user environment to use; the user environment
will set permissions for accessing this memory.
</p>

<h3>Initializing the Kernel Address Space</h3>

<p>
Now you'll set up the address space above <code>UTOP</code>: the
kernel part of the address space.  <code>inc/memlayout.h</code> shows
the layout you should use.  You'll use the functions you just wrote to
set up the appropriate linear to physical mappings.

<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
	Fill in the missing code in <code>i386_vm_init()</code> after the
        call to <code>page_check()</code>.
	<p>
        Your code should now pass the <code>check_boot_pgdir()</code> check.

</p></div>

<p></p>

<div class="todo question">
<span class="header">Answer these questions:</span>
<ol>
<li> What entries (rows) in the page directory have been filled in
     at this point? What addresses do they map and where do they
     point? In other words, fill out this table as much as possible:
     <table border=1>
     <tr><td align="center">Entry</td>
         <td align="center">Base Virtual Address</td>
         <td align="center">Points to (logically):</td></tr>
     <tr><td>1023</td><td>?</td><td>Page table for top 4MB of phys
         memory</td></tr>
     <tr><td>1022</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr>
     <tr><td align="center">.</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr>
     <tr><td align="center">.</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr>
     <tr><td align="center">.</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr>
     <tr><td>2</td><td>0x00800000</td><td>?</td></tr>
     <tr><td>1</td><td>0x00400000</td><td>?</td></tr>
     <tr><td>0</td><td>0x00000000</td><td>[see next question?]</td></tr>
     </table></li>
     
<li> After <code>check_boot_pgdir()</code>,
     <code>i386_vm_init()</code> maps the first four MB of virtual
     address space to the first four MB of physical memory,
     then deletes this mapping at the end of the function.  Why is
     this mapping necessary? What would happen if it were omitted? Does this
     actually limit our kernel to be 4MB? What must be true if our
     kernel were larger than 4MB?</li>

<li> (From Lecture 4) We have placed the kernel and user environment
in the same address space.  Why will user programs not be able to
read or write the kernel's memory? What specific mechanisms protect
the kernel memory?

<li> What is the maximum amount of physical memory that this operating
system can support? Why?

<li> How much space overhead is there for managing memory, if we
actually had the maximum amount of physical memory? How is this
overhead broken down?



<!--
<p> Is there a comparable mechanism on the PDP-11/40 which would
provide the fault isolation necessary to allow the kernel and the user
environment to run in the same address space?  (read: "same address space"
as "with the same set of PARs/PDRs")
-->

	Extend the JOS kernel monitor with commands to:
	<ul>
	<li>	Display in a useful and easy-to-read format
		all of the physical page mappings (or lack thereof)
		that apply to a particular range of virtual/linear addresses
		in the currently active address space.
		For example,
		you might enter <tt>'showmappings 0x3000 0x5000'</tt>
		to display the physical page mappings
		and corresponding permission bits
		that apply to the pages
		at virtual addresses 0x3000, 0x4000, and 0x5000.
	<li>	Explicitly set, clear, or change the permissions
		of any mapping in the current address space.
	<li>	Dump the contents of a range of memory
		given either a virtual or physical address range.
		Be sure the dump code behaves correctly
		when the range extends across page boundaries!
	<li>	Do anything else that you think
		might be useful later for debugging the kernel.

<h3>Address Space Layout Alternatives</h3>

<p>
The address space layout we use in JOS is not the only
one possible.
An operating system might
map the kernel at low linear addresses
while leaving the <i>upper</i> part of the linear address space
for user processes.
x86 kernels generally do not take this approach, however,
because one of the x86's backward-compatibility modes,
known as <i>virtual 8086 mode</i>,
is "hard-wired" in the processor
to use the bottom part of the linear address space,
and thus cannot be used at all if the kernel is mapped there.

<p>
It is even possible, though much more difficult,
to design the kernel so as not to have to reserve <i>any</i> fixed portion
of the processor's linear or virtual address space for itself,
but instead effectively to allow allow user-level processes
unrestricted use of the <i>entire</i> 4GB of virtual address space -
while still fully protecting the kernel from these processes
and protecting different processes from each other!

<div class="todo challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Write up an outline of how a kernel could be designed
	to allow user environments unrestricted use
	of the full 4GB virtual and linear address space.
	Hint: the technique is sometimes known as
	"<i>follow the bouncing kernel</i>."
	In your design,
	be sure to address exactly what has to happen
	when the processor transitions between kernel and user modes,
	and how the kernel would accomplish such transitions.
	Also describe how the kernel
	would access physical memory and I/O devices in this scheme,
	and how the kernel would access
	a user environment's virtual address space
	during system calls and the like.
	Finally, think about and describe
	the advantages and disadvantages of such a scheme
	in terms of flexibility, performance, kernel complexity,
	and other factors you can think of.

<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Since our JOS kernel's memory management system
	only allocates and frees memory on page granularity,
	we do not have anything comparable
	to a general-purpose <tt>malloc</tt>/<tt>free</tt> facility
	that we can use within the kernel.
	This could be a problem if we want to support
	certain types of I/O devices
	that require <i>physically contiguous</i> buffers
	larger than 4KB in size,
	or if we want user-level environments,
	and not just the kernel,
	to be able to allocate and map 4MB <i>superpages</i>
	for maximum processor efficiency.
	(See the earlier challenge problem about PTE_PS.)<br>

	were specified.  By default bochs does not support some
	extended page table features.

	<p>
	Generalize the kernel's memory allocation system
	to support pages of a variety of power-of-two allocation unit sizes
	from 4KB up to some reasonable maximum of your choice.
	Be sure you have some way to divide larger allocation units
	into smaller ones on demand,
	and to coalesce multiple small allocation units
	back into larger units when possible.
	Think about the issues that might arise in such a system.
</p></div>

<div class="todo challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Extend the JOS kernel monitor with commands to
	allocate and free pages explicitly,
	and display whether or not any given page of physical memory
	is currently allocated.
	For example:
	<pre>
	K> alloc_page
		0x13000
	K> page_status 0x13000
		allocated
	K> free_page 0x13000
	K> page_status 0x13000
		free
	</pre>
	Think of other commands or extensions to these commands
	that may be useful for debugging, and add them.
