<h1>6.828 Fall 2007 Lab 3: User Environments</h1>

<p>
<b>Handed out Wednesday, September 26, 2007<br>
Part A due Thursday, October 4, 2007<br>
Part B due Thursday, October 11, 2007<br>
</b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab you will implement the basic kernel facilities
required to get a protected user-mode environment (i.e., "process") running.
You will enhance the JOS kernel
to set up the data structures to keep track of user environments,
create a single user environment,
load a program image into it,
and start it running.
You will also make the JOS kernel capable
of handling any system calls the user environment makes
and handling any other exceptions it causes.

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
In this lab, the terms <i>environment</i> and <i>process</i> are
interchangeable - they have roughly the same meaning.  We introduce the
term "environment" instead of the traditional term "process"
in order to stress the point that JOS environments do not provide
the same semantics as UNIX processes,
even though they are roughly comparable.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
Download our reference code for lab 3 from
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/OSEngineering/labfiles/lab3-handout.tar.gz  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/OSEngineering/labfiles/lab3-handout.tar.gz%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/OSEngineering/labfiles/lab3-handout.tar.gz">
http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab3/lab3-handout.tar.gz</a>,
untar it into your 6.828 directory,
and merge the changes between lab2 and lab3
into your working kernel source tree
as you did before for lab2.
As we mentioned before,
the <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code> utilities
can be very useful for this purpose,
as well as their "big brother" <code>cvs</code>.

<p>
Lab 3 contains a number of new source files,
which you should browse through as your merge them into your kernel:

<p>
In addition, a number of the source files we handed out for lab2
are modified in lab3.
To see the differences, you can type:

<pre>
$ <b>diff -ur lab2 lab3</b>
</pre>

<h3>Lab Requirements</h3>

This lab is divided into two parts, A and B.
Part A is due a week after this lab was assigned;
you should <tt>gmake handin</tt> your lab before the Part A deadline,
even though your code may not yet pass all of the grade script tests.
(If it does, great!)
You only need to have all the grade script tests passing
by the Part B deadline at the end of the second week.

<p>
As in lab 2,
you will need to do all of the regular exercises described in the lab
and <i>at least one</i> challenge problem.
Additionally, you will need to write up brief answers
to the questions posed in the lab
and a short (e.g., one or two paragraph) description of what you did
to solve your chosen challenge problem.
If you implement more than one challenge problem,
you only need to describe one of them in the write-up,
though of course you are welcome to do more.
Place the write-up in a file called <tt>answers.txt</tt> (plain text)
or <tt>answers.html</tt> (HTML format)
in the top level of your <tt>lab2</tt> directory
before handing in your work.

<h3>Debugging tips</h3>

For all its faults, Bochs is still a much more 
hospitable debugging environment than a real processor.
Put it to work for you!  

<ul>
<li>	The command <code>info idt</code> will print
	the current interrupt descriptor table (IDT).
	This is useful for checking whether you set it up correctly.

<li>	The <code>vb</code> command sets a breakpoint
	at a particular <tt>CS:EIP</tt> address.
	Since the kernel code segment selector is 8,
	<code>vb 8:0xf0101234</code>
	sets a breakpoint at the given kernel address.
	Similarly,
	since the user segment selector is 0x1b, <code>vb 0x1b:0x80020</code>
	sets a breakpoint at the given user address.
</ul>

Finally, note that passing all the <code>gmake grade</code> tests
does not mean your code is perfect.  It may have subtle bugs that will
only be tickled by future labs.
All your kernel code is running in the same address space with no protection.
If you get weird crashes
that don't seem to be explainable by a bug in the crashing code,
it's likely that they're due to a bug somewhere else that is
modifying memory used by the crashing code.

<h3>Inline Assembly</h3>

In this section you may find GCC's inline assembly language feature useful,
although it is also possible to complete the lab without using it.
At the very least, you will need to be able to understand
the fragments of inline assembly language ("asm" statements)
that already exist in the source code we gave you.
You can find several sources of information
on GCC inline assembly language
on the class <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html">reference materials</a> page.

<h3>Hand-In Procedure</h3>

<p>
As before,
you can test your code against our test scripts
by running <code>gmake grade</code>.
When you are done,
run <code>gmake handin</code> to tar up and hand in your source tree.
</p>


<h2>Part A: User Environments and Exception Handling</h2>

The new include file <tt>inc/env.h</tt>
contains basic definitions for user environments in JOS;
read it now.
The kernel uses the <tt>Env</tt> data structure
to keep track of each user environment.
In this lab you will initially create just one environment,
but you will need to design the JOS kernel
to support multiple environments;
lab 4 will take advantage of this feature
by allowing a user environment to <tt>fork</tt> other environments.

<p>
As you can see in <tt>kern/env.c</tt>,
the kernel maintains three main global variables
pertaining to environments:

<p>
<pre>
struct Env *envs = NULL;		/* All environments */
struct Env *curenv = NULL;	        /* the current env */
static struct Env_list env_free_list;	/* Free list */
</pre>

<p>
Once JOS gets up and running,
the <tt>envs</tt> pointer points to an array of <tt>Env</tt> structures
representing all the environments in the system.
In our design,
the JOS kernel will support a maximum of <tt>NENV</tt>
simultaneously active environments,
although there will typically be far fewer running environments
at any given time.
(<tt>NENV</tt> is a constant <tt>#define</tt>'d in <tt>inc/env.h</tt>.)
Once it is allocated,
the <tt>envs</tt> array will contain
a single instance of the <tt>Env</tt> data structure
for each of the <tt>NENV</tt> possible environments.

<p>
The JOS kernel keeps all of the inactive <tt>Env</tt> structures
on the <code>env_free_list</code>.
This design allows extremely quick and efficient allocation and
deallocation of environments,
as they merely have to be added to or removed from the free list.

<p>
The kernel uses the <code>curenv</code> variable
to keep track of the <i>currently executing</i> environment at any given time.
During boot up, before the first environment is run,
<tt>curenv</tt> is initially set to <code>NULL</code>.

<h3>Environment State</h3>

The <tt>Env</tt> structure
is defined in <tt>inc/env.h</tt> as follows
(although more fields will be added in future labs):

<p>
<pre>
struct Env {
        struct Trapframe env_tf;        // Saved registers
        LIST_ENTRY(Env) env_link;       // Free list link pointers
        u_int env_id;                   // Unique environment identifier
        u_int env_parent_id;            // env_id of this env's parent
        u_int env_status;               // Status of the environment
                                                                                
        // Address space
        Pde  *env_pgdir;                // Kernel virtual address of page dir
        u_int env_cr3;                  // Physical address of page dir
};
</pre>

<p>
Here's what the <tt>Env</tt> fields are for:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>env_tf</b>:
<dd>	This structure, defined in <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>,
	holds the saved register values for the environment
	while that environment is <i>not</i> running:
	i.e., when the kernel or a different environment is running.
	The kernel saves these when
	switching from user to kernel mode,
	so that the environment can later be resumed where it left off.

<dt><b>env_link</b>:
<dd>	This is a pair of pointers allowing the <tt>Env</tt> to be placed on
	the <code>env_free_list</code>.
	See <code>inc/queue.h</code> for details.

<dt><b>env_id</b>:
<dd>	The kernel stores here a value
	that uniquely identifiers
	the environment currently using this <tt>Env</tt> structure
	(i.e., using this particular slot in the <tt>envs</tt> array).
	After a user environment terminates,
	the kernel may re-allocate
	the same <tt>Env</tt> structure to a different environment -
	but the new environment
	will have a different <tt>env_id</tt> from the old one
	even though the new environment
	is re-using the same slot in the <tt>envs</tt> array.

<dt><b>env_parent_id</b>:
<dd>	The kernel stores here the <tt>env_id</tt>
	of the environment that created this environment.
	In this way the environments can form a ``family tree,''
	which will be useful for making security decisions
	about which environments are allowed to do what to whom.
<dd>

<dt><b>env_status</b>:
<dd>	This variable holds one of the following values:
	<dl>
	<dt><code>ENV_FREE</code>:
	<dd>	Indicates that the <tt>Env</tt> structure is inactive,
		and therefore on the <tt>env_free_list</tt>.
	<dt><code>ENV_RUNNABLE</code>:
	<dd>	Indicates that the <tt>Env</tt> structure
		represents a currently active environment,
		and the environment is waiting to run on the processor.
	<dt><code>ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE</code>:
	<dd>	Indicates that the <tt>Env</tt> structure
		represents a currently active environment,
		but it is not currently ready to run:
		for example, because it is waiting
		for an interprocess communication (IPC)
		from another environment.
	</dl>

<dt><b>env_pgdir</b>:
<dd>	This variable holds the kernel <i>virtual address</i> 
	of this environment's page directory.

<dt><b>env_cr3</b>:
<dd>	This variable holds the corresponding <i>physical address</i>
	for this environment's page directory.
</dl>

<p>
Like a Unix process, a JOS environment couples the concepts of
"thread" and "address space".  The thread is defined primarily by the
saved registers (the <code>env_tf</code> field), and the address space
is defined by the page directory and page tables pointed to by
<code>env_pgdir</code> and <code>env_cr3</code>.  To run an
environment, the kernel must set up the CPU with <i>both</i> the saved
registers and the appropriate address space.
</p>

<p>
Our <code>struct Env</code> is analogous to <code>struct proc</code>
in xv6.  Both structures hold the environment's (i.e., process's)
user-mode register state directly within the <code>env_tf</code>
substructure (dubbed simply <code>tf</code> in the case of xv6).  In JOS,
individual environments do not have their own kernel stacks as
processes do in xv6.  Instead, all JOS kernel code runs on a
<i>single</i> kernel stack.
</p>

<h3>Allocating the Environments Array</h3>

<p>
In lab 2,
you allocated memory in <tt>i386_vm_init()</tt>
for the <code>pages[]</code> array,
which is a table the kernel uses to keep track of
which pages are free and which are not.
You will now need to modify <tt>i386_vm_init()</tt> further
to allocate a similar array of <tt>Env</tt> structures,
called <tt>envs</tt>.

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 1.</b>
	Modify <tt>i386_vm_init()</tt> in <tt>kern/pmap.c</tt>
	to allocate and map the <tt>envs</tt> array.
	This array consists of
	exactly <tt>NENV</tt> instances of the <tt>Env</tt> structure,
	laid out consecutively in the kernel's virtual address space
	starting at address <tt>UENVS</tt>
	(defined in <tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt>).
	You should allocate and map this array
	the same way as you did the <tt>pages</tt> array.
</table></center>


<h3>Creating and Running Environments</h3>

<p>
You will now write the code in <tt>kern/env.c</tt> necessary to run a
user environment.  Because we do not yet have a filesystem, we will
set up the kernel to load a static binary image that is <i>embedded
within the kernel itself</i>. JOS embeds
this binary in the kernel as a <i>real</i> ELF executable image.

<p>
The Lab 3 <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> generates a number of binary images in
the <tt>obj/user/</tt> directory.  If you look at
<tt>kern/Makefrag</tt>, you will notice some magic that "links" these
binaries directly into the kernel executable as if they were
<tt>.o</tt> files.  The <tt>-b binary</tt> option on the linker
command line causes these files to be linked in as "raw" uninterpreted
binary files rather than as regular <tt>.o</tt> files produced by the
compiler.  (As far as the linker is concerned, these files do not have
to be ELF images at all - they could be anything, such as text files
or pictures!)  If you look at <tt>obj/kern/kernel.sym</tt> after
building the kernel, you will notice that the linker has "magically"
produced a number of funny symbols with obscure names like
<tt>_binary_obj_user_hello_start</tt>,
<tt>_binary_obj_user_hello_end</tt>, and
<tt>_binary_obj_user_hello_size</tt>.  The linker generates these
symbol names by mangling the file names of the binary files; the
symbols provide the regular kernel code with a way to reference the
embedded binary files.

<p>
In <tt>i386_init()</tt> in <tt>kern/init.c</tt> you'll see code to run
one of these binary images in an environment.  However, the critical
functions to set up user environments are not complete; you will need
to fill them in.

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 2.</b>
	In the file <code>env.c</code>,
	finish coding the following functions:
	<dl>
	<dt>	<tt>env_init()</tt>:
	<dd>	initialize all of the <tt>Env</tt> structures
		in the <tt>envs</tt> array
		and add them to the <tt>env_free_list</tt>.
	<dt>	<tt>env_setup_vm()</tt>:
	<dd>	allocate a page directory for a new environment
		and initialize the kernel portion
		of the new environment's address space.
	<dt>	<tt>segment_alloc()</tt>:
	<dd>	allocates and maps physical memory for an environment
	<dt>	<tt>load_icode()</tt>:
	<dd>	you will need to parse an ELF binary image,
		much like the boot loader already does,
		and load its contents into the user address space
		of a new environment.
	<dt>	<tt>env_create()</tt>:
	<dd>	allocate an environment with <tt>env_alloc</tt>
		and call <tt>load_icode</tt> load an ELF binary into it.
	<dt>	<tt>env_run()</tt>:
	<dd>	start a given environment running in user mode.
	</dl>

	<p>
	As you write these functions,
	you might find the new cprintf verb <code>%e</code>
	useful -- it prints a description corresponding to an error code.
	For example, 
	<pre>
	r = -E_NO_MEM;
	panic("env_alloc: %e", r);
	</pre>
	will panic with the message "env_alloc: out of memory".
</table></center>

<p>
Once you are done you should compile your kernel and run it under Bochs.
If all goes well, your system should crash in the user program
while it is trying to make a system call, since you haven't implemented
system calls yet; you should examine what happened as
explained below.
Below is a call graph of the code up to the point where the user
code is invoked. 
Make sure you understand the purpose of each step.

    <ul> 
    <li> <code>start</code> (<code>kern/entry.S</code>)
    <li> <code>i386_init</code>
        <ul> 
        <li> <code>cons_init</code>
        <li> <code>i386_detect_memory</code>
        <li> <code>i386_vm_init</code>
        <li> <code>page_init</code>
        <li> <code>env_init</code>
        <li> <code>idt_init</code> (still incomplete at this point)
        <li> <code>env_create</code>
        <li> <code>env_run</code>
            <ul>
            <li> <code>env_pop_tf</code>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<p>
Set a Bochs breakpoint at <tt>env_pop_tf</tt>,
which should be the last function you hit before actually entering user mode.
Step through this function;
the processor should enter user mode after the <tt>iret</tt> instruction.
You should then see the first instruction
in the user environment's executable,
which is the <tt>cmpl</tt> instruction at the label <tt>start</tt>
in <tt>lib/entry.S</tt>.
You should be able to single-step through
this user mode environment code
until you first hit an <tt>int&nbsp;$0x30</tt> instruction,
which is the instruction that user-mode code executes
to make a system call.  Unless you've changed the code  
in <tt>i386_init</tt>, the first system call you'll hit
is <tt>sys_cputs</tt>, which is called by 
<tt>cprintf</tt> to put characters to the console.
(See <tt>lib/syscall.c</tt> for more details.)
If you cannot get to this point,
then something is wrong with your address space setup
or program loading code;
go back and fix it before continuing.

<h3>Handling Interrupts and Exceptions</h3>

At this point,
the first <tt>int&nbsp;$0x30</tt> system call instruction in user space
is a dead end:
once the processor gets into user mode,
there is no way to get back out.
You will now need to implement
basic exception and system call handling,
so that it is possible for the kernel to recover control of the processor
from user-mode code.
The first thing you should do
is thoroughly familiarize yourself with
the x86 interrupt and exception mechanism.

<p>
In this lab we generally follow Intel's terminology
for interrupts, exceptions, and the like.
However,
terms such as exception, trap, interrupt, fault and
abort have no standard meaning
across architectures or operating systems,
and are often used without regard to the subtle distinctions between them
on a particular architecture such as the x86.
When you see these terms outside of this lab,
the meanings might be slightly different.
</p>

<h3>Basics of Protected Control Transfer</h3>

Exceptions and interrupts are both
"protected control transfers,"
which cause the processor to switch from user to kernel mode
(CPL=0) without giving the user-mode code any opportunity
to interfere with the functioning of the kernel or other environments.
In Intel's terminology,
an <i>interrupt</i> is a protected control transfer
that is caused by an asynchronous event usually external to the processor,
such as notification of external device I/O activity.
An <i>exception</i>, in contrast,
is a protected control transfer
caused synchronously by the currently running code,
for example due to a divide by zero or an invalid memory access.

<p>
In order to ensure that these protected control transfers
are actually <i>protected</i>,
the processor's interrupt/exception mechanism is designed so that
the code currently running when the interrupt or exception occurs
<i>does not get to choose arbitrarily where the kernel is entered or how</i>.
Instead,
the processor ensures that the kernel can be entered
only under carefully controlled conditions.
On the x86, this protection is provided
on the basis of two particular mechanisms:

<p>
<ol>
<li><p>	<b>The Interrupt Descriptor Table.</b>
	The processor ensures that interrupts and exceptions
	can only cause the kernel to be entered
	at a few specific, well-defined entry-points
	<i>determined by the kernel itself</i>,
	and not by the code currently running
	when the interrupt or exception is taken.

	<p>
	The x86 allows up to 256 different
        interrupt or exception entry points into the kernel,
        each with a different <i>interrupt vector</i>.
        A vector is a number between 0 and 256.
        An interrupt's vector is determined by the
        source of the interrupt: different devices, error
        conditions, and application requests to the kernel
        generate interrupts with different vectors.
        The CPU uses the vector as an index
	into the processor's <i>interrupt descriptor table</i> (IDT),
	which the kernel sets up in kernel-private memory,
	much like the GDT.
	From the appropriate entry in this table
	the processor loads:
	<ul>
	<li>	the value to load into
		the instruction pointer (<tt>EIP</tt>) register,
		pointing to the kernel code designated
		to handle that type of exception.
	<li>	the value to load into
		the code segment (<tt>CS</tt>) register,
		which includes in bits 0-1 the privilege level
		at which the exception handler is to run.
		(In JOS, all exceptions are handled in kernel mode,
		or privilege level 0.)
	</ul>

<li><p>	<b>The Task State Segment.</b>
	The processor needs a place
	to save the <i>old</i> processor state
	before the interrupt or exception occurred,
	such as the original values of <tt>EIP</tt> and <tt>CS</tt>
	before the processor invoked the exception handler,
	so that the exception handler can later restore that old state
	and resume the interrupted code from where it left off.
	But this save area for the old processor state
	must in turn be protected from unprivileged user-mode code;
	otherwise buggy or malicious user code
	could easily compromise the kernel.

	<p>
	For this reason,
	when an x86 processor takes an interrupt or trap
	that causes a privilege level change from user to kernel mode,
        it also switches to a stack in the kernel's memory.
	The processor pushes (on this new stack)
        <tt>SS</tt>, <tt>ESP</tt>, <tt>EFLAGS</tt>, <tt>CS</tt>, <tt>EIP</tt>, and an optional error code.
        Then it loads the <tt>CS</tt> and <tt>EIP</tt> from the interrupt descriptor,
        and the new kernel-memory <tt>ESP</tt> and <tt>SS</tt>.
	The new <tt>ESP</tt> and <tt>SS</tt>
	come from a structure
	called the <i>task state segment</i> (TSS).

	<p>
	Although the TSS is large
	and can potentially serve a variety of purposes,
	JOS only uses it to define
	the kernel stack that the processor should switch to
	when it transfers from user to kernel mode.
	Since "kernel mode" in JOS
	is privilege level 0 on the x86,
	the processor uses the <tt>ESP0</tt> and <tt>SS0</tt> fields of the TSS
	to define the kernel stack when entering kernel mode.
        JOS doesn't use any other TSS fields.
</ol>

<h3>Types of Exceptions and Interrupts</h3>

<p>
All of the synchronous exceptions
that the x86 processor can generate internally
use interrupt vectors between 0 and 31,
and therefore map to IDT entries 0-31.
For example,
a page fault always causes an exception through vector 14.
Interrupt vectors greater than 31 are only used by
<i>software interrupts</i>,
which can be generated by the <tt>INT</tt> instruction, or
asynchronous <i>hardware interrupts</i>,
caused by external devices when they need attention.

<p>
In this section we will extend JOS to handle
the internally generated x86 exceptions in vectors 0-31.
In the next section we will make JOS handle
software interrupt vector 0x30,
which JOS (fairly arbitrarily) uses as its system call interrupt vector.
In Lab 4 we will extend JOS to handle externally generated hardware interrupts
such as the clock interrupt.

<h3>An Example</h3>

Let's put these pieces together and trace through an example.
Let's say the processor is executing code in a user environment
and encounters a divide instruction that attempts to divide by zero.

<ol>
<li>	The processor switches to the stack defined by the
	<tt>SS0</tt> and <tt>ESP0</tt> fields of the TSS,
	which in JOS will hold the values
	<tt>GD_KD</tt> and <tt>KSTACKTOP</tt>, respectively.

<li>	The processor pushes the exception parameters on the
	kernel stack, starting at address <tt>KSTACKTOP</tt>:
	<pre>
                     +--------------------+ KSTACKTOP             
                     | 0x00000   old SS   |     " - 4
                     |      old ESP       |     " - 8
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 12
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 16
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 20 <---- ESP 
                     +--------------------+             
	</pre>
<!-- " -->

<li>	Because we're handling a divide error,
	which is interrupt vector 0 on the x86,
	the processor reads IDT entry 0 and sets
	<code>CS:EIP</code> to point to the handler function defined there.

<li>	The handler function takes control and handles the exception,
	for example by terminating the user environment.
</ol>

<p>
For certain types of x86 exceptions,
in addition to the "standard" five words above,
the processor pushes onto the stack another word
containing an <i>error code</i>.
The page fault exception, number 14,
is an important example.
See the 80386 manual to determine for which exception numbers
the processor pushes an error code,
and what the error code means in that case.
When the processor pushes an error code,
the stack would look as follows at the beginning of the exception handler
when coming in from user mode:
	<pre>
                     +--------------------+ KSTACKTOP             
                     | 0x00000   old SS   |     " - 4
                     |      old ESP       |     " - 8
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 12
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 16
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 20
                     |     error code     |     " - 24 <---- ESP 
                     +--------------------+             
	</pre>

<h3>Nested Exceptions and Interrupts</h3>

<p>
The processor can take exceptions and interrupts
both from kernel and user mode.
It is only when entering the kernel from user mode, however,
that the x86 processor automatically switches stacks
before pushing its old register state onto the stack
and invoking the appropriate exception handler through the IDT.
If the processor is <i>already</i> in kernel mode
when the interrupt or exception occurs
(the low 2 bits of the <tt>CS</tt> register are already zero),
then the kernel just pushes more values on the same kernel stack.
In this way, the kernel can gracefully handle <i>nested exceptions</i>
caused by code within the kernel itself.
This capability is an important tool in implementing protection,
as we will see later in the section on system calls.

<p>
If the processor is already in kernel mode
and takes a nested exception,
since it does not need to switch stacks,
it does not save the old <tt>SS</tt> or <tt>ESP</tt> registers.
For exception types that do not push an error code,
the kernel stack therefore looks like the following
on entry to the exception handler:
<pre>
                     +--------------------+ <---- old ESP
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 4
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 8
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 12
                     +--------------------+             
</pre>
<!-- " -->

<p>
For exception types that push an error code,
the processor pushes the error code immediately after the old <tt>EIP</tt>,
as before.

<p>
There is one important caveat to the processor's nested exception capability.
If the processor takes an exception while already in kernel mode,
and <i>cannot push its old state onto the kernel stack</i> for any reason
such as lack of stack space,
then there is nothing the processor can do to recover,
so it simply resets itself.
Needless to say, the kernel should be designed so that this can't happen.

<h3>Setting Up the IDT</h3>

<p>
You should now have the basic information you need
in order to set up the IDT and handle exceptions in JOS.
For now, you will set up the IDT to handle 
interrupt vectors 0-31 (the processor exceptions)
and interrupts 32-47 (the device IRQs).
We may add additional interrupts later.

<p>
The header files <tt>inc/trap.h</tt> and <tt>kern/trap.h</tt>
contain important definitions related to interrupts and exceptions
that you will need to become familiar with.
The file <tt>kern/trap.h</tt> contains definitions
that are strictly private to the kernel,
while <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>
contains definitions that may also be useful
to user-level programs and libraries.
</p>

<p>
Note:
Some of the exceptions in the range 0-31 are defined by Intel to be
reserved.
Since they will never be generated by the processor,
it doesn't really matter how you handle them.
Do whatever you think is cleanest.
</p>

<p>
The overall flow of control that you should achieve is depicted below: 
</p>

<pre>
      IDT                   trapentry.S         trap.c
   
+----------------+                        
|   &handler1    |---------> handler1:          trap (struct Trapframe *tf)
|                |             // do stuff      {
|                |             call trap          // handle the exception/interrupt
|                |             // undo stuff    }
+----------------+
|   &handler2    |--------> handler2:
|                |            // do stuff
|                |            call trap
|                |            // undo stuff
+----------------+
       .
       .
       .
+----------------+
|   &handlerX    |--------> handlerX:
|                |             // do stuff
|                |             call trap
|                |             // undo stuff
+----------------+
</pre>

<p>
Each exception or interrupt should have
its own handler in <code>trapentry.S</code>
and <tt>idt_init()</tt> should initialize the IDT with the addresses
of these handlers.
Each of the handlers should build a <code>struct Trapframe</code>
(see <code>inc/trap.h</code>) on the stack and call 
<code>trap()</code> (in <code>trap.c</code>)
with a pointer to the Trapframe.
</p>

<p>
<code>trap()</code> handles the
exception/interrupt or dispatches to a specific
handler function.
If and when <tt>trap()</tt> returns,
the code in <tt>trapentry.S</tt>
restores the old CPU state saved in the Trapframe
and then uses the <tt>iret</tt> instruction
to return from the exception.
</p>

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 4.</b>

	Edit <code>trapentry.S</code> and <code>trap.c</code> and
	implement the features described above.  The macros
	<code>TRAPHANDLER</code> and <code>TRAPHANDLER_NOEC</code> in
	<code>trapentry.S</code> should help you, as well as the T_*
	defines in <code>inc/trap.h</code>.  You will need to add an
	entry point in <code>trapentry.S</code> (using those macros)
	for each trap defined in <code>inc/trap.h</code>.  You will
	also need to modify <code>idt_init()</code> to initialize the
	<code>idt</code> to point to each of these entry points
	defined in <code>trapentry.S</code>; the <tt>SETGATE</tt>
        macro will be helpful here.
	</p>

	<p>
	Hint: your code should perform the following steps:

	<li>push values to make the stack look like a struct Trapframe
	<li>load GD_KD into <tt>%ds</tt> and <tt>%es</tt>

<h4>Questions</h4>
Answer the following questions in your <tt>answers.txt</tt>:
<ol>
<li>	What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for
	each exception/interrupt?  (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were
	delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in
	the current implementation could not be provided?)

<li>	Did you have to do anything
	to make the <tt>user/softint</tt> program behave correctly
	(i.e., as the grade script expects)?
	<i>Why</i> is this the correct behavior?
	What happens if the kernel actually allows <tt>softint</tt>'s
	<tt>int $14</tt> instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler
	(which is interrupt vector 14)?
</ol>

<h2>Part B: Page Faults, Breakpoints Exceptions, and System Calls</h2>

Now that your kernel has basic exception handling capabilities,
you will refine it to provide important operating system primitives
that depend on exception handling.

<h3>Handling Page Faults</h3>

The page fault exception, interrupt vector 14 (<tt>T_PGFLT</tt>),
is a particularly important one that we will exercise heavily
throughout this lab and the next.
When the processor takes a page fault,
it stores the linear address that caused the fault
in a special processor control register, <tt>CR2</tt>.
In <tt>trap.c</tt>
we have provided the beginnings of a special function,
<tt>page_fault_handler()</tt>,
to handle page fault exceptions.

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 5.</b>
	Modify <tt>trap_dispatch()</tt>
	to dispatch page fault exceptions
	to <tt>page_fault_handler()</tt>.
	You should now be able to get <tt>make grade</tt>
	to succeed on the <tt>faultread</tt>, <tt>faultreadkernel</tt>,
	<tt>faultwrite</tt>, and <tt>faultwritekernel</tt> tests.
	If any of them don't work, figure out why and fix them.
</table></center>

<p>
You will further refine the kernel's page fault handling below,
as you implement system calls.

<h3>The Breakpoint Exception</h3>

The breakpoint exception, interrupt vector 3 (<tt>T_BRKPT</tt>),
is normally used to allow debuggers
to insert breakpoints in a program's code
by temporarily replacing the relevant program instruction
with the special 1-byte <tt>int3</tt> software interrupt instruction.
In JOS we will abuse this exception slightly
by turning it into a primitive pseudo-system call
that any user environment can use to invoke the JOS kernel monitor.
This usage is actually somewhat appropriate
if we think of the JOS kernel monitor as a primitive debugger.
The user-mode implementation of <tt>panic()</tt> in <tt>lib/panic.c</tt>,
for example,
performs an <tt>int3</tt> after displaying its panic message.

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 6.</b>
	Modify <tt>trap_dispatch()</tt>
	to make breakpoint exceptions invoke the kernel monitor.
	You should now be able to get <tt>make grade</tt>
	to succeed on the <tt>breakpoint</tt> test.
</table></center>

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#ffe0e0>
	<i>Challenge!</i>
	Modify the JOS kernel monitor so that
	you can 'continue' execution from the current location
	(e.g., after the <tt>int3</tt>,
	if the kernel monitor was invoked via the breakpoint exception),
	and so that you can single-step one instruction at a time.
	You will need to understand certain bits
	of the <tt>EFLAGS</tt> register
	in order to implement single-stepping.

	<p>
	<i>Optional:</i>
	If you're feeling really adventurous,
	find some x86 disassembler source code -
	e.g., by ripping it out of Bochs,
	or out of GNU binutils, or just write it yourself -
	and extend the JOS kernel monitor
	to be able to disassemble and display instructions
	as you are stepping through them.
	Combined with the symbol table loading 
        from lab 2,
	this is the stuff of which real kernel debuggers are made.
</table></center>

<h4>Questions</h4>
Answer the following questions in your <tt>answers.txt</tt>:
<ol>
<li>	The break point test case will either generate a break point
	exception or a general protection fault depending on how you initialized
	the break point entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to
	<code>SETGATE</code> from <code>idt_init</code>).  Why?
	How did you need to set it in order to get the breakpoint exception
	to work as specified above?

<li>	What do you think is the point of these mechanisms,
	particularly in light of
	what the <tt>user/softint</tt> test program does?
</ol>


<h3>System calls</h3>

User processes ask the kernel to do things for them by
invoking system calls.  When the user process invokes a system call,
the processor enters kernel mode,
the processor and the kernel cooperate
to save the user process's state,
the kernel executes appropriate code in order to carry out the system
call, and then resumes the user process.  The exact
details of how the user process gets the kernel's attention
and how it specifies which call it wants to execute vary
from system to system.
<p>

<!--
In V6, user processes executed the <code>sys</code> instruction
to get the kernel's attention.
The user process specifies the type of system call
with a constant in the instruction itself.  The
arguments to the system call are also in the instruction
stream, or in registers, or on the stack, or some combination
of the three.  The kernel passes the return value
back to the user process in <code>r0</code>.
<p>
-->

In the JOS kernel, we will use the <code>int</code>
instruction, which causes a processor interrupt.
In particular, we will use <code>int&nbsp;$0x30</code>
as the system call interrupt.
We have defined the constant
<code>T_SYSCALL</code> to 0x30 for you.  You will have to
set up the interrupt descriptor to allow user processes to
cause that interrupt.  Note that interrupt 0x30 cannot be
generated by hardware, so there is no ambiguity caused by
allowing user code to generate it.
<p>

The application will pass the system call number and
the system call arguments in registers.  This way, the kernel won't
need to grub around in the user environment's stack
or instruction stream.  The
system call number will go in <code>%eax</code>, and the
arguments (up to five of them) will go in <code>%edx</code>,
<code>%ecx</code>, <code>%ebx</code>, <code>%edi</code>,
and <code>%esi</code>, respectively.  The kernel passes the
return value back in <code>%eax</code>.  The assembly code to
invoke a system call has been written for you, in
<code>syscall()</code> in <code>lib/syscall.c</code>.  You
should read through it and make sure you understand what
is going on.
<p>

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 7.</b>
	Add a handler in the kernel
	for interrupt vector <code>T_SYSCALL</code>.
	You will have to edit <code>kern/trapentry.S</code> and
	<code>kern/trap.c</code>'s <code>idt_init()</code>.  You
	also need to change <code>trap_dispatch()</code> to handle the
	system call interrupt by calling <code>syscall()</code>
	(defined in <tt>kern/syscall.c</tt>)
	with the appropriate arguments,
	and then arranging for
	the return value to be passed back to the user process
	in <code>%eax</code>.
	Finally, you need to implement <code>syscall()</code> in
	<code>kern/syscall.c</code>.
	Make sure <code>syscall()</code> returns <code>-E_INVAL</code>
	if the system call number is invalid.
	You should read and understand <code>lib/syscall.c</code>
	(especially the inline assembly routine) in order to confirm
	your understanding of the system call interface.
	You may also find it helpful to read <code>inc/syscall.h</code>.

	<p>
	Run the <tt>user/hello</tt> program under your kernel.
	It should print "<code>hello, world</code>" on the console
	and then cause a page fault in user mode.
	If this does not happen, it probably means
	your system call handler isn't quite right.
</table></center>

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#ffe0e0>
	<i>Challenge!</i>

	Implement system calls using the <code>sysenter</code> and
	<code>sysexit</code> instructions instead of using
	<code>int&nbsp;0x30</code> and <code>iret</code>.  <br>

	The <code>sysenter/sysexit</code> instructions were designed
	by Intel to be faster than <code>int/iret</code>.  They do
	this by using registers instead of the stack and by making
	assumptions about how the segmentation registers are used.
	The exact details of these instructions can be found in Volume
	2B of the Intel reference manuals.<br>

	The easiest way to add support for these instructions in JOS
	is to add a <code>sysenter_handler</code> in
	<code>kern/trapentry.S</code> that creates the same trap frame
	that is normally created by an <code>int&nbsp;0x30</code>
	instruction (being sure to save the correct return address and
	stack pointer provided by the user environment).  Then,
	instead of calling into <code>trap</code>, push the arguments
	to <code>syscall</code> and call <code>syscall</code>
	directly.  Once <code>syscall</code> returns, set everything
	up for and execute the <code>sysexit</code> instruction. <br>

	You will also need to add code to <code>kern/init.c</code> to
	set up the necessary model specific registers (MSRs).  Look at
	the <code>enable_sep_cpu</code> function in <a
	href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://lwn.net/Articles/18414/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://lwn.net/Articles/18414/%27" tppabs="http://lwn.net/Articles/18414/">this diff</a> for an
	example of this, and you can find an implementation of
	<code>wrmsr</code> to add to <code>/inc/x86.h</code> <a
	href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/k6mod.c  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/k6mod.c%27" tppabs="http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/k6mod.c">here</a>).
	Finally, <code>lib/syscall.c</code> must be changed to support
	making a system call with <code>sysenter</code>.  Here is a
	possible register layout for the <code>sysenter</code>
	instruction:<br>

	<pre>
	eax                - syscall number
	edx, ecx, ebx, edi - arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4
	esi                - return pc
	ebp                - return esp
	esp                - trashed by sysenter
        </pre>

	GCC's inline assembler does not support directly loading
	values into <code>ebp</code>, so you will need to add code to
	save (push) and restore (pop) it yourself (and you may want to
	do the same thing for <code>esi</code> as well).  The return
	address can be put into <code>esi</code> by using an
	instruction like <code>leal after_sysenter_label,
	%%esi</code>. <br>

	Note that this only supports 4 arguments, so you will need to
	leave the old method of doing system calls around if you want
	to support 5 argument system calls as well.<br>

	Finally, in order for Bochs to support these instructions, it
	must be compiled with the <code>--enable-sep</code> option, in
	addition to the other options listed on the tools page.

<h3>User-mode startup</h3>

<p>
A user program starts running at the top of
<code>lib/entry.S</code>.  After some setup, this code
calls <code>libmain()</code>, in <code>lib/libmain.c</code>.
You should modify <code>libmain()</code> to initialize the global pointer
<code>env</code> to point at this environment's
<code>struct Env</code> in the <code>envs[]</code> array.
(Note that <code>lib/entry.S</code> has already defined <code>envs</code>
to point at the <code>UENVS</code> mapping you set up in lab 2.)
Hint: look in <code>inc/env.h</code> and use
<code>sys_getenvid</code>.

<p>
<code>libmain()</code> then calls <code>umain</code>, which,
in the case of the hello program, is in
<code>user/hello.c</code>.  Note that after printing
"<code>hello, world</code>", it tries to access
<code>env->env_id</code>.  This is why it faulted earlier.
Now that you've initialized <code>env</code> properly,
it should not fault.
If it still faults, you probably haven't mapped the
<code>UENVS</code> area user-readable (back in lab 1 in 
<code>pmap.c</code>; this is the first time we've actually
used the <code>UENVS</code> area).

	<b>Exercise 8.</b>
	Add the required code to the user library, then 
	boot your kernel.  You should see <code>user/hello</code>
	print "<code>hello, world</code>" and then print "<code>i
	am environment 00000800</code>".
	<tt>user/hello</tt> then attempts to "exit"
	by calling <tt>sys_env_destroy()</tt>
	(see <tt>lib/libmain.c</tt> and <tt>lib/exit.c</tt>).
	Since the kernel currently only supports one user environment,
	it should report that it has destroyed the only environment
	and then drop into the kernel monitor.

<h3>Page faults and memory protection</h3>

<p>
Memory protection is a crucial feature of an operating system,
ensuring that
bugs in one program cannot corrupt other programs or corrupt the operating
system itself.

<p>
Operating systems usually rely on hardware support
to implement memory protection. 
The OS keeps the hardware informed about which virtual addresses
are valid and which are not.  When a program tries to access an invalid
address or one for which it has no permissions, the processor stops the
program at the instruction causing the fault and then traps
into the kernel with information about the attempted operation.
If the fault is fixable, the kernel can fix it and let the program 
continue running.  If the fault is not fixable, then the program cannot
continue, since it will never get past the instruction causing the fault.

<p>
As an example of a fixable fault, consider an automatically extended stack.
In many systems the kernel initially allocates a single stack page, and then
if a program faults accessing pages further down the stack, the kernel
will allocate those pages automatically and let the program continue.
By doing this, the kernel only allocates as much stack memory as
the program needs, but the program can work under the illusion that it
has an arbitrarily large stack.

<p>
System calls present an interesting problem for memory protection.
Most system call interfaces let user programs pass pointers to the 
kernel.  These pointers point at user buffers to be read or written.
The kernel then dereferences these pointers
while carrying out the system call.
There are two problems with this:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
	A page fault in the kernel
	is taken a lot more seriously than a page fault in a user program.
	If the kernel page-faults, that's usually a kernel bug, and the
	fault handler will panic the kernel
	(and hence the whole system).
	In a system call,
	when the kernel is dereferencing pointers to the user's address space,
	we need a way to remember that any page faults these dereferences cause
	are actually on behalf of the user program.
	<p>

<li>
	The kernel typically has more memory permissions than the user program.
	The user program might pass a pointer to a system call that points
        to memory that the kernel can read or write but that the program
        cannot.
        The kernel must be careful not to be tricked into dereferencing
        such a pointer, since that might reveal private information or
	destroy the integrity of the kernel.
</ol>

<!-- 
This danger is one instance of a classic security problem
known as the "confused deputy" problem.
The kernel is acting as a trusted "deputy",
which has the special privileges necessary
to implement important services needed by untrusted users -
but if users can confuse the kernel into using those special privileges
in unintended ways, the security model breaks down.

            (<i>Challenge</i>!!! Explore the literature
		on the confused deputy problem
		available on the Internet,
		and identify other aspects of the design of this toy kernel
		and existing well-known operating systems
		in which this security risk may occur.)
            <p>
-->

<p>
For both of these reasons the kernel must be extremely careful when 
handling pointers presented by user programs.

<p>
You will now solve these two problems with 
a single mechanism that scrutinizes
all pointers passed from userspace into the kernel.
When a program passes the kernel a pointer, the kernel will check
that the address is in the user part of the address space,
and that the page table would allow the memory operation.

<p>
Thus, the kernel will never suffer a page fault due to dereferencing
a user-supplied pointer.
If the kernel does page fault, it should panic and terminate.

<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 9.</b>

	Change <code>kern/trap.c</code> to panic if a page
   	fault happens in kernel mode.

	<p>
	Hint: to determine whether a fault happened in user mode or
	in kernel mode, check the low bits of the <code>tf_cs</code>.

	<p>Read <code>user_mem_assert</code> in <code>kern/pmap.c</code>
  	and implement <code>user_mem_check</code> in that same file.

	<p>
	Change <code>kern/syscall.c</code> to sanity check arguments
	to system calls.

	<p>
	Change <code>kern/init.c</code> to run <code>user/buggyhello</code>
	instead of <code>user/hello</code>.  Compile your kernel and boot it.
	The environment should be destroyed,
	and the kernel should <i>not</i> panic.
	You should see:

	<pre>
	[00001000] user_mem_check assertion failure for va 00000001
	[00001000] free env 00001000
	Destroyed the only environment - nothing more to do!
	</pre>
</table></center>

<p>
Note that the same mechanism you just implemented also works for 
malicious user applications (such as <code>user/evilhello</code>).

<center><table border=1 width=80%><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e0ff>
	<b>Exercise 10.</b>

	<p>
	Change <code>kern/init.c</code> to run <code>user/evilhello</code>.
	Compile your kernel and boot it.
	The environment should be destroyed,
	and the kernel should not panic.
	You should see:

	<pre>
	[00000000] new env 00001000
	[00001000] user_mem_check assertion failure for va f0100020
	[00001000] free env 00001000
