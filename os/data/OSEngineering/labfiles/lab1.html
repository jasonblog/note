<h1>6.828 Fall 2007 Lab 1: Booting a PC</h1>
<p>
<b>Handed out Wednesday, September 5, 2007<br>
Due Thursday, September 13, 2007</b>

</p>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This lab is split into three parts.
The first part concentrates on getting familiarized
with x86 assembly language,
the Bochs x86 emulator,
and the PC's power-on bootstrap procedure.
The second part examines the boot loader for our 6.828 kernel,
which resides in the <tt>boot</tt> directory of the <tt>lab1</tt> tree.
Finally, the third part delves into the initial template
for our 6.828 kernel itself,
named JOS,
which resides in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.

<p>
<h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>
The files you will need for this lab
are available at
<a href="lab1.tar.gz" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/OSEngineering/labfiles/lab1.tar.gz"
><tt>http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab1/lab1.tar.gz</tt></a>.
To install them in your Athena account, do this:
<pre>
athena% <b>cd ~/6.828</b>
athena% <b>wget http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/6.828/2007/labs/lab1/lab1.tar.gz</b>
athena% <b>gtar xzvf lab1.tar.gz</b>
athena% <b>cd lab1</b>
athena% 
</pre>

<p>We have set up the appropriate compilers and simulators for you on
Athena (use '<tt>add 6.828</tt>').
You must use an i386 Athena machine; that is, <tt>uname -a</tt>
should mention <tt>i386 GNU/Linux</tt> or <tt>i686 GNU/Linux</tt>.
You can log into a public i386 Athena host with <tt>ssh -X linerva.mit.edu</tt>.
If you are working on
a non-athena machine, the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/tools.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/tools.html%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/tools.html">tools page</a>
has directions on how to set up <tt>bochs</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> for
use with 6.828.

<p>
<h3>Hand-In Procedure</h3>

<p>
When you are ready to hand in your lab,
run <tt>gmake handin</tt> in the <tt>lab1</tt>
directory. This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/cgi-bin/828handin  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/cgi-bin/828handin%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/cgi-bin/828handin">web interface</a>.  <tt>gmake handin</tt>
provides more specific directions.

<p>
You do not need to turn in answers
to any of the questions in the text of the lab.
(Do answer them for yourself though!  They will help with the rest of the lab.)
<p>
We will be grading your solutions with a grading program.
You can run <tt>gmake grade</tt>
to test your solutions with the grading program.


<h2>Part 1: PC Bootstrap</h2>

The purpose of the first exercise
is to introduce you to x86 assembly language
and the PC bootstrap process,
and to get you started with the Bochs debugger.
You will not have to write any code for this part of the lab,
but you should go through it anyway for your own understanding
and be prepared to answer the questions posed below.

<h3>Getting Started with x86 assembly</h3>

<p>
If you are not already familiar with x86 assembly language,
you will quickly become familiar with it during this course!
The <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf">PC Assembly Language Book</a>
is an excellent place to start.
Hopefully, the book contains mixture of new and old material for you.

<p><i>Warning:</i> Unfortunately the examples in the book are
written for the NASM assembler, whereas we will be using
the GNU assembler. NASM uses the so-called <i>Intel</i> syntax
while GNU uses the <i>AT&amp;T</i> syntax. While semantically
equivalent, an assembly file will differ quite a lot, at least
superficially, depending on which syntax is used. Luckily the
conversion between the two is pretty simple, and is covered in
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html%27" tppabs="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html">Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly</a>.

<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
  Read or at least carefully scan the entire
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf">PC Assembly Language</a> book,
except that you should skip all sections after 1.3.5 in chapter 1,
which talk about features of the NASM assembler
that do not apply directly to the GNU assembler.
You may also skip chapters 5 and 6, and all sections under 7.2,
which deal with processor and language features we won't use in 6.828.
</p>
<p>
Also read the section "The Syntax" in
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html%27" tppabs="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html">Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly</a>
to familiarize yourself with the most important features
of GNU assembler syntax.
</p>
</div>
<p>

<p>Certainly the definitive reference for x86 assembly language programming
is Intel's instruction set architecture reference,
which you can find on
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html">the 6.828 reference page</a>
in two flavors:
an HTML edition of the old

which is much shorter and easier to navigate than more recent manuals
but describes all of the x86 processor features
that we will make use of in 6.828;
and the full, latest and greatest
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://developer.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://developer.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm%27" tppabs="http://developer.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm">
IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manuals</a> from Intel,

which also covers the new 64-bit extensions
now appearing in both AMD and Intel processors.

<p>You should read the recommended chapters of the PC Assembly
book, and "The Syntax" section in Brennan's Guide now.
Save the Intel/AMD architecture manuals for later
or use them for reference when you want to look up
the definitive explanation
of a particular processor feature or instruction.</p>


<h3>Simulating the x86</h3>

Instead of developing the operating system on a real, physical personal computer
(PC), we use a simulator, which emulates a complete PC faithfully:
the code you write for the simulator will boot on a real PC too.
Using a simulator simplifies debugging; you can, for example, set
break points inside of the simulated x86, which is difficult
to do with the silicon-version of an x86.

<p>
In 6.828 we will use the
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/%27" tppabs="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs PC Emulator</a>.
This emulator has been around for quite a while,
and is slow and quirky but has a great many useful features.
Another freely available PC emulator
is <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/%27" tppabs="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a>,
which is much faster than Bochs but has less mature debugging facilities.
You are welcome to give QEMU a try
(or any of the commercially available PC virtual machine programs),
but our 6.828 lab assignments will assume (and sometimes require)
that you are running under Bochs.

<p>
To get started,
extract the Lab 1 files into your own directory on Athena
as described above in "Software Setup",
then type <samp>gmake</samp> in the <samp>lab1</samp> directory
to build the minimal 6.828 boot loader and kernel you will start with.
(It's a little generous to call the code we're running here a "kernel,"
but we'll flesh it out throughout the semester.)

<pre>
athena% <b>cd lab1</b>
athena% <b>gmake</b>
+ as kern/entry.S
+ cc kern/init.c
+ cc kern/console.c
+ cc kern/monitor.c
+ cc kern/printf.c
+ cc lib/printfmt.c
+ cc lib/readline.c
+ cc lib/string.c
+ ld obj/kern/kernel
+ as boot/boot.S
+ cc -Os boot/main.c
+ ld boot/boot
boot block is 414 bytes (max 510)
+ mk obj/kern/bochs.img
</pre>

<p>
Now you're ready to run Bochs.
The necessary configuration file for Bochs,
named <tt>.bochsrc</tt>,
is already supplied for you in the <tt>lab1</tt> directory.
This <tt>.bochsrc</tt> includes a command
to make Bochs use the file <tt>obj/kern/bochs.img</tt>,
created above,
as the contents of the simulated PC's "virtual hard disk"
once Bochs starts running.
This simulated hard disk image contains both
our boot loader (<tt>obj/boot/boot</tt>)
and our kernel (<tt>obj/kern/kernel</tt>).

<pre>
athena% <b>bochs</b>
========================================================================
                       Bochs x86 Emulator 2.2.6
                Build from CVS snapshot on January 29, 2006
========================================================================
00000000000i[     ] reading configuration from .bochsrc
------------------------------
Bochs Configuration: Main Menu
------------------------------
 
This is the Bochs Configuration Interface, where you can describe the
machine that you want to simulate.  Bochs has already searched for a
configuration file (typically called bochsrc.txt) and loaded it if it
could be found.  When you are satisfied with the configuration, go
ahead and start the simulation.
 
You can also start bochs with the -q option to skip these menus.
 
1. Restore factory default configuration
2. Read options from...
3. Edit options
4. Save options to...
5. Begin simulation
6. Quit now
 
Please choose one: [5]
</pre>

Bochs has read the file <tt>.bochsrc</tt>
describing the virtual x86 PC it will emulate for our kernel,
and it is stopping to give you an opportunity to change the settings
if desired before beginning the actual simulation.
Since the configuration settings are already correct,
just press Enter to start the simulation.
(As Bochs points out,
you can bypass this step in the future
by typing '<tt>bochs -q</tt>' instead of just '<tt>bochs</tt>'.)

<pre>
Next at t=0
(0) [0xfffffff0] f000:fff0 (unk. ctxt): jmp f000:e05b             ; ea5be000f0
&lt;bochs:1&gt;
</pre>

Bochs has now started the
simulated machine,
and is ready to execute the first instruction.
An X window should have popped up
to show the "virtual display" of the simulated PC.
The window is blank because the simulated PC hasn't booted yet -
it's frozen in the state a real PC would be in
just after being turned on and coming out of hardware reset
but before executing any instructions.

<p>
The text that Bochs printed on your normal shell window,
and the <tt>&lt;bochs:1&gt;</tt> prompt,
is part of the Bochs debugging interface,
which you can use to control and examine the state of the simulated PC.
The main reference for this debugging interface
that you should become familiar with is the section
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html%27" tppabs="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html">

Bochs User Manual</a>.
You can always get a reminder of the names of the most common commands
by typing <tt>help</tt>:

<pre>
&lt;bochs:1&gt; <b>help</b>
help - show list of debugger commands
help 'command'- show short command description
-*- Debugger control -*-
    help, q|quit|exit, set, instrument, show, trace-on, trace-off,
    record, playback, load-symbols, slist
-*- Execution control -*-
    c|cont, s|step|stepi, p|n|next, modebp
-*- Breakpoint management -*-
    v|vbreak, lb|lbreak, pb|pbreak|b|break, sb, sba, blist,
    bpe, bpd, d|del|delete
-*- CPU and memory contents -*-
    x, xp, u|disas|disassemble, r|reg|registers, setpmem, crc, info, dump_cpu,
    set_cpu, ptime, print-stack, watch, unwatch, ?|calc
</pre>

<p>
  Note that bochs uses Intel assembler syntax by default. If you
  prefer AT&amp;T syntax, you can execute the command <code>
  disassemble switch-mode</code> (or <code>u switch-mode</code>) at
  the <code>&lt;bochs&gt;</code> prompt. Unfortunately, there does not
  appear to be a way to change the default setting.
</p>

<p>
For now, type <tt>c</tt> to "continue" (i.e., start) execution
from the current point.
Some text should now appear in the Bochs window,
ending with:

<pre>
Booting from Hard Disk...
6828 decimal is XXX octal!
entering test_backtrace 5
entering test_backtrace 4
entering test_backtrace 3
entering test_backtrace 2
entering test_backtrace 1
entering test_backtrace 0
leaving test_backtrace 0
leaving test_backtrace 1
leaving test_backtrace 2
leaving test_backtrace 3
leaving test_backtrace 4
leaving test_backtrace 5
Welcome to the JOS kernel monitor!
Type 'help' for a list of commands.
K&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Everything after '<tt>Booting from Hard Disk...</tt>'
was printed by our skeletal JOS kernel;
the <tt>K&gt;</tt> is the prompt printed by
the small <i>monitor</i>, or interactive control program,
that we've included in the kernel.
These lines printed by the kernel
will also appear in the regular shell window from which you ran Bochs.
This is because for testing and lab grading purposes
we have set up the JOS kernel to write its console output
not only to the virtual VGA display (as seen in the Bochs window),
but also to the simulated PC's virtual parallel port,
which Bochs outputs to its own standard output
because of a particular line we included in our <tt>.bochsrc</tt>.
(Identify that line!)

<p>
The kernel monitor is currently pretty boring;
it only knows about two not particularly useful commands:

<pre>
K&gt; <b>help</b>
help - display this list of commands
kerninfo - display information about the kernel
K&gt; <b>kerninfo</b>
Special kernel symbols:
  _start f010000c (virt)  0010000c (phys)
  etext  f0101436 (virt)  00101436 (phys)
  edata  f0114558 (virt)  00114558 (phys)
  end    f0114bc0 (virt)  00114bc0 (phys)
Kernel executable memory footprint: 83KB
K&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>help</tt> command is obvious,
and we will shortly discuss
the meaning of what the <tt>kerninfo</tt> command prints.

Although simple,
it's important to note that this kernel monitor
is running "directly" on the "raw (virtual) hardware"
of the simulated PC.
This means that you should be able to copy
the contents of <tt>obj/kern/bochs.img</tt>
onto the first few sectors of a <i>real</i> hard disk,
insert that hard disk into a real PC,
turn it on,
and see exactly the same thing on the PC's real screen
as you did above in the Bochs window.
(We don't recommend you do this on a real machine
with useful information on its hard disk, though,
because copying <tt>bochs.img</tt> onto the beginning of its hard disk
will trash the master boot record and the beginning of the first partition,
effectively causing everything previously on the hard disk to be lost!)

to get a feel for these commands and their syntax.
Play with the commands a little:
do some stepping and tracing through the code,
examining CPU registers and memory
and disassembling instructions at different points,
without worrying too much yet about what the code is actually doing.
While the kernel monitor is waiting for user input
(or at any other time the simulation is running),
you can always hit CTRL-C in the shell window from which you ran Bochs
in order to halt the simulation and break back into the Bochs debugger.
Be sure you understand the distinction between
which software you're interacting with
when you type commands in the kernel monitor
versus in the Bochs debugger.

<h3>The PC's Physical Address Space</h3>

We will now dive into a bit more detail
about how a PC starts up.
A PC's physical address space is hard-wired
to have the following general layout:

<p>
<table align=center><tr><td>
<pre>
+------------------+  <- 0xFFFFFFFF (4GB)
|      32-bit      |
|  memory mapped   |
|     devices      |
|                  |
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
|                  |
|      Unused      |
|                  |
+------------------+  <- depends on amount of RAM
|                  |
|                  |
| Extended Memory  |
|                  |
|                  |
+------------------+  <- 0x00100000 (1MB)
|     BIOS ROM     |
+------------------+  <- 0x000F0000 (960KB)
|  16-bit devices, |
|  expansion ROMs  |
+------------------+  <- 0x000C0000 (768KB)
|   VGA Display    |
+------------------+  <- 0x000A0000 (640KB)
|                  |
|    Low Memory    |
|                  |
+------------------+  <- 0x00000000
</pre>
</table>

The first PCs,
which were based on the 16-bit Intel 8088 processor,
were only capable of addressing 1MB of physical memory.
The physical address space of an early PC
would therefore start at 0x00000000
but end at 0x000FFFFF instead of 0xFFFFFFFF.
The 640KB area marked "Low Memory"
was the <i>only</i> random-access memory (RAM) that an early PC could use;
in fact the very earliest PCs only could be configured with
16KB, 32KB, or 64KB of RAM!

<p>
The 384KB area from 0x000A0000 through 0x000FFFFF
was reserved by the hardware for special uses
such as video display buffers
and firmware held in non-volatile memory.
The most important part of this reserved area
is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS),
which occupies the 64KB region from 0x000F0000 through 0x000FFFFF.
In early PCs the BIOS was held in true read-only memory (ROM),
but current PCs store the BIOS in updateable flash memory.
The BIOS is responsible for performing basic system initialization
such as activating the video card and checking the amount of memory installed.
After performing this initialization,
the BIOS loads the operating system from some appropriate location
such as floppy disk, hard disk, CD-ROM, or the network,
and passes control of the machine to the operating system.

<p>
When Intel finally "broke the one megabyte barrier"
with the 80286 and 80386 processors,
which supported 16MB and 4GB physical address spaces respectively,
the PC architects nevertheless preserved the original layout
for the low 1MB of physical address space
in order to ensure backward compatibility with existing software.
Modern PCs therefore have a "hole" in physical memory
from 0x000A0000 to 0x00100000,
dividing RAM into "low" or "conventional memory" (the first 640KB)
and "extended memory" (everything else).
In addition,
some space at the the very top of the PC's 32-bit physical address space,
above all physical RAM,
is now commonly reserved by the BIOS
for use by 32-bit PCI devices.

<p>
Recent x86 processors can support
<i>more</i> than 4GB of physical RAM,
so RAM can extend further above 0xFFFFFFFF.
In this case the BIOS must arrange to leave a <i>second</i> hole
in the system's RAM at the top of the 32-bit addressable region,
to leave room for these 32-bit devices to be mapped.
Because of design limitations JOS
will use only the first 256MB
of a PC's physical memory anyway,
so for now we will pretend that all PCs
have "only" a 32-bit physical address space.
But dealing with complicated physical address spaces
and other aspects of hardware organization
that evolved over many years
is one of the important practical challenges of OS development.


<h3>The ROM BIOS</h3>

Close and restart Bochs,
so that you once again see the first instruction to be executed:

<pre>
Next at t=0
(0) [0xfffffff0] f000:fff0 (unk. ctxt): jmp far f000:e05b             ; ea5be000f0
&lt;bochs:1&gt;
</pre>

<p>
From this output you can conclude a few things: 

<ul>
<!-- No longer true in new BOCHS
<li>	The IBM PC starts executing at physical address 0x000ffff0,
	which is at the very top of the 64KB area reserved for the ROM BIOS.
	You know that this is the first instruction
	because of the message "<tt>Next at t=0</tt>" ("time 0").
-->

<li>	The PC starts executing
	with <tt>CS = 0xf000</tt> and <tt>IP = 0xfff0</tt>.

<li>	The first instruction to be executed is a <tt>jmp</tt> instruction,
	which jumps to the segmented address
	<tt>CS = 0xf000</tt> and <tt>IP = 0xe05b</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
Why does the Bochs start like this?
This is how Intel designed the 8088 processor,
which IBM used in their original PC.
Because the BIOS in a PC is "hard-wired"
to the physical address range 0x000f0000-0x000fffff,
this design ensures that the BIOS always gets control of the machine first
after power-up or any system restart -
which is crucial because on power-up
there <i>is</i> no other software anywhere in the machine's RAM
that the processor could execute.
The Bochs simulator comes with its own BIOS,
which it maps at this location
in the processor's simulated physical address space.
On processor reset,
the (simulated) processor enters real mode
and sets CS to 0xf000 and the IP to 0xfff0, so that
execution begins at that (CS:IP) segment address.
How does the segmented address 0xf000:fff0
turn into a physical address?
</p>

<p>To answer that we need to know a bit about real mode addressing.
In real mode (the mode that PC starts off in),
address translation works according to the formula:
<i>physical address</i> = 16 * <i>segment</i> + <i>offset</i>.
So, when the PC sets CS to 0xf000 and IP to
0xfff0, the physical address referenced is:</p>

<pre>
   16 * 0xf000 + 0xfff0   # in hex multiplication by 16 is
   = 0xf0000 + 0xfff0     # easy--just append a 0.
   = 0xffff0 
</pre>

<p>
We can see that the PC starts executing 16 bytes from the end
of the BIOS code. Therefore we shouldn't be surprised that the
first thing that the BIOS does is <tt>jmp</tt> backwards
to an earlier location in the BIOS; after all
how much could it accomplish in just 16 bytes?

<p>
As a final curiosity, note that Bochs is displaying the address
<tt>0xfffffff0</tt> in brackets where it normally displays the physical
address:
<pre>
Next at t=0
(0) [0xfffffff0] f000:fff0 (unk. ctxt): jmp far f000:e05b             ; ea5be000f0
&lt;bochs:1&gt;
</pre>
We expect <tt>0xffff0</tt>.

	No need to figure out all the details -
	just the general idea of what the BIOS is doing first.
</div>

<p>
When the BIOS runs,
it sets up an interrupt descriptor table
and initializes various devices such as the VGA display.
This is where the "<tt>Plex86/Bochs VGABios</tt>" messages
you see in the Bochs window come from.

<p>
After initializing the PCI bus
and all the important devices the BIOS knows about,
it searches for a bootable device
such as a floppy, hard drive, or CD-ROM.
Eventually, when it finds a bootable disk,
the BIOS reads the <i>boot loader</i> from the disk
and transfers control to it.

<h2>Part 2: The Boot Loader</h2>

<p>Floppy and hard disks for PCs are by historical convention
divided up into 512 byte regions called <i>sectors</i>.
A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity:
each read or write operation must be one or more sectors in size
and aligned on a sector boundary.
If the disk is bootable,
the first sector is called the <i>boot sector</i>,
since this is where the boot loader code resides.
When the BIOS finds a bootable floppy or hard disk,
it loads the 512-byte boot sector
into memory at physical addresses 0x7c00 through 0x7dff,
and then uses a <tt>jmp</tt> instruction
to set the CS:IP to <tt>0000:7c00</tt>,
passing control to the boot loader.
Like the BIOS load address,
these addresses are fairly arbitrary -
but they are fixed and standardized for PCs.

<p>
The ability to boot from a CD-ROM came much later
during the evolution of the PC,
and as a result the PC architects took the opportunity
to rethink the boot process slightly.
As a result,
the way a modern BIOS boots from a CD-ROM
is a bit more complicated (and more powerful).
CD-ROMs use a sector size of 2048 bytes instead of 512,
and the BIOS can load a much larger boot image from the disk into memory
(not just one sector)
before transferring control to it.

<p>
For 6.828, however,
we will use the conventional hard drive boot mechanism,
which means that our boot loader must fit into a measly 512 bytes.
The boot loader consists of
one assembly language source file, <tt>boot/boot.S</tt>,
and one C source file, <tt>boot/main.c</tt>
Look through these source files carefully
and make sure you understand what's going on.
The boot loader must perform two main functions:

<ol>
<li>	First, the boot loader switches the processor from real mode to
	<i>32-bit protected mode</i>,
	because it is only in this mode
	that software can access all the memory above 1MB
	in the processor's physical address space.
	Protected mode is described briefly
	in sections 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 of
	<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/pcasm-book.pdf">PC Assembly Language</a>,
	and in great detail in the Intel architecture manuals.
	At this point you only have to understand
	that translation of segmented addresses (segment:offset pairs)
	into physical addresses happens differently in protected mode,
	and that after the transition
	offsets are 32 bits instead of 16.

<li>	Second, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk
	by directly accessing the IDE disk device registers
	via the x86's special I/O instructions.
	If you would like to understand better
	what the particular I/O instructions here mean,
	check out the "IDE hard drive controller" section
	on <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/reference.html">the 6.828 reference page</a>.
	You will not need to learn much
	about programming specific devices in this class:
	writing device drivers is in practice
	a very important part of OS development,
	but from a conceptual or architectural viewpoint
	it is also one of the least interesting.
</ol>

<p>
After you understand the boot loader source code,
look at the file <tt>obj/boot/boot.asm</tt>.
This file is a disassembly of the boot loader
that our GNUmakefile creates <i>after</i> compiling the boot loader.
This disassembly file makes it easy to see
exactly where in physical memory all of the boot loader's code resides,
and makes it easier to track what's happening
while stepping through the boot loader in Bochs.

<p>
You can set breakpoints in Bochs with the <tt>b</tt> command.  You
have to start hex numbers with <tt>0x</tt>, so say something like <tt>b
0x7c00</tt>.  A full command overview is <a
href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html%27" tppabs="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html"
>here</a>.
From the debugger, you can continue execution using the <tt>c</tt> and
<tt>s</tt> commands: <tt>c</tt> causes Bochs to continue execution
indefinitely; and <tt>s</tt> allows you to step through the
instructions, executing exactly <tt>n</tt> instructions (a default of
1 if the parameter <tt>n</tt> is not specified) before suspending execution
again. <tt>trace-on</tt> and <tt>trace-off</tt> can be used to set
tracing before using the other commands.

<p>
To examine instructions in memory
(besides the immediate next one to be executed,
which Bochs prints automatically),
you use the <tt>u</tt> command.
This command has the syntax <tt>u/<i>n</i> <i>addr</i></tt>,
where <i>n</i> is the number of consecutive instructions to disassemble
and <i>addr</i> is the memory address at which to start disassembling.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
	Set a breakpoint at address 0x7c00, which is
	where the boot sector will be loaded.
	Continue execution until that break point.
	Trace through the code in <tt>boot/boot.S</tt>,
	using the source code and the disassembly file
	<tt>obj/boot/boot.asm</tt> to keep track of where you are.
	Also use the <tt>u</tt> command in Bochs to disassemble
	sequences of instructions in the boot loader,
	and compare the original boot loader source code
	with both the GNU disassembly in <tt>obj/boot/boot.asm</tt>
	and the Bochs disassembly from the <tt>u</tt> command.
</p>
	<p>
	Trace into <tt>bootmain()</tt> in <tt>boot/main.c</tt>,

	that reads the remaining sectors of the kernel from the disk.
	Find out what code will run when the loop is finished,
	set a breakpoint there, and continue to that breakpoint.
	Then step through the remainder of the boot loader.

	Where does it find this information?

<h3> Loading the Kernel </h3>

We will now look in further detail
at the C language portion of the boot loader,
in <tt>boot/main.c</tt>.
But before doing so,
this is a good time to stop and review
some of the basics of C programming.

<p>

</div>

<p>
To make sense out of <tt>boot/main.c</tt>
you'll need to know what an ELF binary is.
When you compile and link a C program such as the JOS kernel,
the compiler transforms each C source ('<tt>.c</tt>') file
into an <i>object</i> ('<tt>.o</tt>') file
containing assembly language instructions
encoded in the binary format expected by the hardware.
The linker then combines all of the compiled object files
into a single <i>binary image</i> such as <tt>obj/kern/kernel</tt>,
which in this case is a binary in the ELF format,
which stands for "Executable and Linkable Format".

<p>
Full information about this format is available in
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/elf.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/elf.pdf%27" tppabs="http://grid.hust.edu.cn/zyshao/Teaching_Material/readings/elf.pdf">the ELF specification</a>

but you will not need to delve very deeply
into the details of this format in this class.
Although as a whole the format is quite powerful and complex,
most of the complex parts are for supporting
dynamic loading of shared libraries,
which we will not do in this class.

<p>
For purposes of 6.828,
you can consider an ELF executable to be
a header with loading information,
followed by several <i>program sections</i>,
each of which is a contiguous chunk of code or data
intended to be loaded into memory at a specified address.
The boot loader does not modify the code or data; it
loads it into memory and starts executing it.

<p>
An ELF binary starts with a fixed-length <i>ELF header</i>,
followed by a variable-length <i>program header</i>
listing each of the program sections to be loaded.
The C definitions for these ELF headers are in <tt>inc/elf.h</tt>.
The program sections we're interested in are:
<ul>
<li>	<tt>.text</tt>:
	The program's executable instructions.
<li>	<tt>.rodata</tt>:
	Read-only data,
	such as ASCII string constants produced by the C compiler.
	(We will not bother setting up the hardware to prohibit writing,
        however.)
<li>	<tt>.data</tt>:
	The data section holds the program's initialized data,
	such as global variables declared with initializers
	like <tt>int x = 5;</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
When the linker computes the memory layout of a program,
it reserves space for <i>uninitialized</i> global variables,
such as <tt>int x;</tt>,
in a section called <tt>.bss</tt>
that immediately follows <tt>.data</tt> in memory.
C requires that "uninitialized" global variables start with
a value of zero.
Thus there is no need to store contents for <tt>.bss</tt>
in the ELF binary; instead, the linker records just the address and
size of the <tt>.bss</tt> section.
The loader or the program itself must arrange to zero the
<tt>.bss</tt> section.

<p>
You can display a full list of the names, sizes, and link addresses
of all the sections in the kernel executable by typing:

<pre>
athena% <b>i386-jos-elf-objdump -h obj/kern/kernel</b>
</pre>

<p>
You will see many more sections than the ones we listed above,
but the others are not important for our purposes.
Most of the others are to hold debugging information,
which is typically included in the program's executable file
but not loaded into memory by the program loader.

<p>
Besides the section information,
there is one more field in the ELF header that is important to us,
named <tt>e_entry</tt>.
This field holds the link address
of the <i>entry point</i> in the program:
the memory address in the program's text section
at which the program should begin executing.
You can see the entry point:
<pre>
athena% <b>i386-jos-elf-objdump -f obj/kern/kernel</b>
</pre>

<p>
To examine memory in the Bochs simulator, you use the
<tt>x</tt> command, which has the same syntax as <tt>gdb</tt>'s.
The command overview (linked above) has full details.
For now, it is enough to know that
the recipe <tt>x/<i>n</i>x <i>addr</i></tt>
prints <i>n</i> words of memory at addr.
(Note that both '<tt>x</tt>'s in the command are lowercase.)

<p>
<i>Warning</i>: The size of a word is not a universal standard. To
Bochs, a word is four bytes. In GNU assembly, a word is two
bytes (the 'w' in xorw, which stands for word, means 2 bytes).</p>

<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
	Reset the machine (exit bochs and start it again).
	Examine the 8 words of memory at 0x00100000 
	at the point the BIOS enters the boot loader,
	and then again at the point the boot loader enters the kernel.
	Why are they different?
	What is there at the second breakpoint?
	(You do not really need to use Bochs to answer this question.
	Just think.)
</p></div>


<p>
<h3>Link vs. Load Address</h3>
<p>
The <i>load address</i> of a binary
is the memory address at which a binary is <i>actually</i> loaded.
For example, the BIOS is loaded by the PC hardware at
address 0xf0000. So this is the BIOS's load address.
Similarly, the BIOS loads the boot sector at address 0x7c00. So
this is the boot sector's load address.</p>

<p>
The <i>link address</i> of a binary
is the memory address for which the binary is linked.
Linking a binary for a given link address
prepares it to be loaded at that address. 
A program's link address in practice becomes
subtly encoded within the binary in a multitude of ways,
with the result that if a binary is not loaded
at the address that it is linked for,
things will not work.</p>

<p>In one sentence:
the link address is the location where a binary
<i>assumes</i> it is going to be loaded,
while the load address is the location
where a binary <i>is</i> loaded.
It's up to us to make sure that they turn out to be the same.

<p>
Look at the <tt>-Ttext</tt> linker command
in <tt>boot/Makefrag</tt>,
and at the address mentioned
early in the linker script in <tt>kern/kernel.ld</tt>.
These set the link address for the boot loader and kernel respectively.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
	Trace through the first few instructions of the boot loader again
	and identify the first instruction that would "break"
	or otherwise do the wrong thing
	if you were to get the boot loader's link address wrong.
	Then change the link address in <tt>boot/Makefrag</tt>
	to something wrong,
        run <tt>gmake clean</tt>,
	recompile lab1 with <tt>gmake</tt>,
	and trace into the boot loader again to see what happens.
	Don't forget to change the link address back afterwards!
</p></div>

<p>
When object code contains no absolute addresses that
``subtly encode'' the link address in this fashion,
we say that the code is <i>position-independent</i>:
it will behave correctly no matter where it is loaded.
GCC can generate position-independent code using the <tt>-fpic</tt> option,
and this feature is used extensively in modern shared libraries
that use the ELF executable format.
Position independence typically has some performance cost, however,
because it restricts the ways in which the compiler may choose instructions
to access the program's data.
We will not use <tt>-fpic</tt> in 6.828.

<h2>Part 3: The Kernel</h2>

We will now start to examine the minimal JOS kernel in a bit more detail.
(And you will finally get to write some code!)

Like the boot loader,
the kernel begins with some assembly language code
that sets things up so that C language code can execute properly.

<h3>Using segmentation to work around position dependence</h3>
<p>

Did you notice above
that while the boot loader's link and load addresses match perfectly,
there appears to be a (rather large) disparity
between the <i>kernel's</i> link and load addresses?
Go back and check both and make sure you can see what we're talking about.

<p>
Operating system kernels often like to be linked and run
at very high <i>virtual address</i>, such as 0xf0100000,
in order to leave the lower part of the processor's virtual address space
for user programs to use.
The reason for this arrangement will become clearer in the next lab.

<p>
Many machines don't have any physical memory at address 0xf0100000,
so we can't count on being able to store the kernel there.
Instead, we will use the processor's memory management hardware
to map virtual address 0xf0100000 -
the link address at which the kernel code <i>expects</i> to run -
to physical address 0x00100000 -
where the boot loader loaded the kernel.
This way, although the kernel's virtual address is high enough
to leave plenty of address space for user processes,
it will be loaded in physical memory at the 1MB point in the PC's RAM,
just above the BIOS ROM.
This approach requires that the PC have at least a few megabytes of
physical memory (so that address 0x00100000 works), but this is likely
to be true of any PC built after about 1990.

<p>
We will map the <i>entire</i> bottom 256MB
of the PC's physical address space,
from 0x00000000 through 0x0fffffff,
to virtual addresses 0xf0000000 through 0xffffffff respectively.
You should now be able to see why the JOS kernel is limited to using
only the first 256MB of physical memory in a PC.

<p>
The x86 processor has two distinct memory management mechanisms
that JOS could use to achieve this mapping:
<i>segmentation</i> and <i>paging</i>.
Both are described in full detail in the

When the JOS kernel first starts up,
it initially uses segmentation
to establish the desired virtual-to-physical mapping,
because it is quick and easy -
and the x86 processor requires us
to set up the segmentation hardware in any case,
because it can't be disabled!

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
	Use Bochs to trace into the JOS kernel
	and find where the new virtual-to-physical mapping takes effect.
	Then examine the Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
	that the code uses to achieve this effect,
	and make sure you understand what's going on.
        </p>
	<p>
	What is the first instruction <i>after</i> the new
        mapping is established that would fail to work properly
	if the old mapping were still in place?
	Comment out or otherwise intentionally break
	the segmentation setup code in <tt>kern/entry.S</tt>,
	trace into it in Bochs,
	and see if you were right.

<h3>Formatted Printing to the Console</h3>

Most people take functions like <tt>printf()</tt> for granted,
sometimes even thinking of them as "primitives" of the C language.
But in an OS kernel, we have to implement all I/O ourselves.

<code>console.c</code> export?  How is this function used by
<code>printf.c</code>?

<li> Explain the following from <code>console.c</code>:
<pre>
1      if (crt_pos >= CRT_SIZE) {
2              int i;
3              memcpy(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS, (CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));
4              for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i < CRT_SIZE; i++)
5                      crt_buf[i] = 0x0700 | ' ';
6              crt_pos -= CRT_COLS;
7      }
</pre>

<li> For the following questions you might wish to consult
the notes for Lecture 2.
These notes cover GCC's calling convention on the x86.

<p>
Trace the execution of the following code step-by-step:
<pre>
int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>	In the call to <code>cprintf()</code>,
	to what does <code>fmt</code> point?
	To what does <code>ap</code> point?

<li> List (in order of execution) each call to
<code>cons_putc</code>, <code>va_arg</code>, and <code>vcprintf</code>.
For <code>cons_putc</code>, list its argument as well.  For
<code>va_arg</code>, list what <code>ap</code> points to before and
after the call.  For <code>vcprintf</code> list the values of its
two arguments.

</ul>
<li> Run the following code.
<pre>
    unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
    cprintf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
</pre>

What is the output?  Explain how this output is arrived out in the
step-by-step manner of the previous exercise.

<p>The output depends on that fact that the x86 is little-endian.  If
the x86 were instead big-endian what would you set <code>i</code> to in
order to yield the same output?  Would you need to change
<code>57616</code> to a different value?

Let's say that GCC changed its calling convention so that it

<h3>The Stack</h3>

In the final exercise of this lab,
we will explore in more detail
the way the C language uses the stack on the x86,
and in the process write a useful new kernel monitor function
that prints a <i>backtrace</i> of the stack:
a list of the saved Instruction Pointer (IP) values
from the nested <tt>call</tt> instructions that
led to the current point of execution.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
	Determine where the kernel initializes its stack,
	and exactly where in memory its stack is located.
	How does the kernel reserve space for its stack?
	And at which "end" of this reserved area
	is the stack pointer initialized to point to?
</p></div>

<p>
The x86 stack pointer (<tt>esp</tt> register)
points to the lowest location on the stack that is
currently in use.
Everything <i>below</i> that location in the region reserved for the stack
is free.
Pushing a value onto the stack involves decreasing the stack
pointer and then writing the value to the place the stack pointer
points to.
Popping a value from the stack involves reading the value
the stack pointer points to and then increasing the stack pointer.
In 32-bit mode, the stack can only hold 32-bit values,
and esp is always divisible by four.
Various x86 instructions, such as <tt>call</tt>,
are "hard-wired" to use the stack pointer register.

<p>
The <tt>ebp</tt> register, in contrast,
is associated with the stack primarily by software convention.
On entry to a C function,
the function's <i>prologue</i> code normally
saves the previous function's base pointer by pushing it onto the stack,
and then copies the current <tt>esp</tt> value into <tt>ebp</tt>
for the duration of the function.
If all the functions in a program consistently obey this convention,
then at any given point during the program's execution,
it is possible to trace back through the stack
by following the chain of saved <tt>ebp</tt> pointers
and determining exactly what nested sequence of function calls
caused this particular point in the program to be reached.
This capability can be particularly useful, for example,
when a particular function causes an <tt>assert</tt> failure or <tt>panic</tt>
because bad arguments were passed to it,
but you aren't sure <i>who</i> passed the bad arguments.
A stack backtrace lets you find the offending function.

<div class="todo required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
	To become familiar with the C calling conventions on the x86,
	find the address of the <tt>test_backtrace</tt> function
	in <tt>obj/kern/kernel.asm</tt>,
	set a breakpoint there in Bochs,
	and examine what happens each time it gets called
	after the kernel starts.
        There are two ways you can set this breakpoint:
        with the <tt>b</tt> command and a physical address,
        or with the <tt>vb</tt> command, a segment selector
        (use 8 for the code segment),
        and a virtual address.
	How many 32-bit words does each recursive nesting level
	of <tt>test_backtrace</tt> push on the stack,
	and what are those words?
</p></div>

<p>
The above exercise should give you the information you need
to implement a stack backtrace function,
which you should call <tt>mon_backtrace()</tt>.
A prototype for this function is already waiting for you
in <tt>kern/monitor.c</tt>.
You can do it entirely in C,
but you may find the <tt>read_ebp()</tt> function in <tt>inc/x86.h</tt> useful.
You'll also have to hook this new function
into the kernel monitor's command list
so that it can be invoked interactively by the user.

<p>
The backtrace function should display a listing of function call frames
in the following format:

<pre>
Stack backtrace:
  ebp f0109e58  eip f0100a62  args 00000001 f0109e80 f0109e98 f0100ed2 00000031
  ebp f0109ed8  eip f01000d6  args 00000000 00000000 f0100058 f0109f28 00000061
  ...
</pre>

<p>
The first line printed reflects the <i>currently executing</i> function,
namely <tt>mon_backtrace</tt> itself,
the second line reflects the function that called <tt>mon_backtrace</tt>,
the third line reflects the function that called that one, and so on.
You should print <i>all</i> the outstanding stack frames.
By studying <tt>kern/entry.S</tt>
you'll find that there is an easy way to tell when to stop.

<p>
Within each line,
the <tt>ebp</tt> value indicates the base pointer into the stack
used by that function:
i.e., the position of the stack pointer just after the function was entered
and the function prologue code set up the base pointer.
The listed <tt>eip</tt> value
is the function's <i>return instruction pointer</i>:
the instruction address to which
control will return when the function returns.
The return instruction pointer typically points to the instruction
after the <tt>call</tt> instruction (why?).
Finally, the five hex values listed after <tt>args</tt>
are the first five arguments to the function in question,
which would have been pushed on the stack just before the function was called.
If the function was called with fewer than five arguments, of course,
then not all five of these values will be useful.
(Why can't the backtrace code detect how many arguments there actually are?
How could this limitation be fixed?)

<p>
Here are a few specific points you read about in K&R Chapter 5 that are
worth remembering for the following exercise and for future labs.
<ul>
<li>If <code>int *p = (int*)100</code>, then 
    <code>(int)p + 1</code> and <code>(int)(p + 1)</code>
    are different numbers: the first is <code>101</code> but
    the second is <code>104</code>.
    When adding an integer to a pointer, as in the second case,
    the integer is implicitly multiplied by the size of the object
    the pointer points to.
<li><code>p[i]</code> is defined to be the same as <code>*(p+i)</code>,
referring to the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.
The above rule for addition helps this definition work
when the objects are larger than one byte.
<li> <code>&p[i]</code> is the same as <code>(p+i)</code>, yielding
the address of the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.
</ul>
Although most C programs never need to cast between pointers and integers,
operating systems frequently do.
Whenever you see an addition involving a memory address,
ask yourself whether it is an integer addition or pointer addition
and make sure the value being added is appropriately multiplied
or not.
